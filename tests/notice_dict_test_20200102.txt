She\nsaid, according to La R.S. 48:391, the department is supposed\nto evaluate the need to close any public railroad crossing. She\ncontinued to say that after they do that, if the evaluation suggests\nclosing, there are certain procedures to follow, such as:\n1. Provide written notice to the local governing\nauthority, which they didn\ufffdt, the railroad company,\nand any affected person owning land within two\nmiles of the railroad crossing, which they didn\ufffdt.\n2. Once they give notice, she would have had a\nchance, within 30 days, to respond. Because they\ndidn\ufffdt give notice, she didn\ufffdt know about it and\ndidn\ufffdt have a chance to respond.\n3. The Department shall attempt to address any\nconcerns. She said they didn\ufffdt follow any of the\nprocedures.\n4. A Notice of Intent to close the crossing should have\nbeen sent, and at that time, a copy of the Intent\nshould have been mailed to the Parish/Council.\nThe local governing authority could submit a\nwritten request to their Chief Engineer of the\nrailroad for a reconsideration of the department\ufffds\ndetermination, which they didn\ufffdt do. Then, the\nrailroad would consider a board, composed of the\nsecretary, the chief engineer of the railroad\ncrossing, and the executive director of the\nLouisiana Highway Safety Commission, shall\nconsider the determination of closing the railroad\ncrossing. And, only then, they would have to\ndetermine, it must be in a manner in which the\nrailroad crossing, they have to prove, unreasonably\nburdens or substantially interferes with the rail\ntransportation.\nPRESENTATION\nTyler Jasmin spoke on the Biddy Basketball Program.

On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. Articles I through III of this Chapter do not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. Articles I through III of this Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on such articles or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.\nSec. 14-13. - Penalties for noncompliance.\nNo structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of Articles I through IV of this Chapter and other applicable regulations, Violation of the provisions of Articles I through III of this Chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates Articles I through III of this Chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $100.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, for each violation. Each day the violation continues shall be deemed a new violation. In addition, the violator shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case.

All analysis must be complete in accordance with the applicable sections of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations.\nDesignated flood hazard area/identified flood hazard area means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map, Zone A is usually refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, VO or V1-30, VE, or V. For purposes of these regulations, the term \ufffdspecial flood hazard\ufffd is synonymous in meaning with the phrase \ufffdarea of special flood hazard\ufffd or \ufffdflood hazard area\ufffd.\nDrainage impact analysis means analysis prepared by and signed and sealed by a professional engineer registered in the state that formulates the impact of the stormwater runoff of a proposed development on the area drainage system. It typically addresses the characterization of the site development, grading plan, peak rates of stormwater runoff, retention/detention volumes for the required design storm event, site and area drainage system design criteria for storm conveyance, and measures to control stormwater runoff from the development into the existing area drainage system. The drainage impact analysis must be based on the proposed development design plans depicting design of the development drainage system, roadways and other related infrastructure.\nFloodplain or flood area means any land susceptible to being inundated by water from any source.\nFloodplain impact analysis means an engineering evaluation of a flooding source performed through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses to provide peak flood discharges and elevations of floods for the frequencies of occurrence.
