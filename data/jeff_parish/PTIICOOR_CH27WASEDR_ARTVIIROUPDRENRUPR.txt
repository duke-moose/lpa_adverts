In the event there is no water line fronting the property, it will be the responsibility of the owner/developer to install and/or extend the standard size water line, minimum eight (8) inches to front the property with all required hydrants and valves in accordance with the current parish standards and requirements, prior to applying for water meters.
All material and installation must also meet the parish requirements. Engineering plans and specifications stamped by a professional engineer must be provided to the parish for review and approval prior to any installations.
(b)
When the owner/developer chooses to obtain the services of the water department or it's contractor to install the required water line, the director of the water department may waive the requirements for the owners to provide engineering plans and specifications. The owner/developer is responsible for the charges and expenses. These charges must be paid before any water line installation. The cost of installing the water line does not include the water meter installation cost, and deposit.

Any water line larger than twelve (12) inches is considered to be transmission lines. Transmission lines cannot be tapped for any three-quarter-inch, one-inch and two-inch water meters. The director of the water department may waive this requirement.
Properties that front streets with water transmission lines and not main water lines are considered not having water to serve these properties and the above article is applicable to them.

Any water line inside the private property line will be maintained by the property owner.
