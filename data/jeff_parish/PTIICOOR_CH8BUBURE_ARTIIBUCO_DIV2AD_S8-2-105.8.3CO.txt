COMPARE VERSIONS
When required by the board a hold harmless agreement must be signed by the owner(s) and recorded in the Conveyance Office of Jefferson Parish within the amount of time the board designates. A request for an extension of time to record the conditions of the variance may be granted by the board providing the request is made in writing to the board and good cause is shown for such extension. The request for an extension of time must be made before the initial time to record set by the board has expired. If the extension is not granted and/or the hold harmless is not filed within the allotted time frame granted, the variance becomes null and void and a new appeal/application must be filed.
