c.
Amortization of short-term rentals.
1.
Findings. The Parish Council finds that:
i.
Generally, Jefferson Parish is characterized by a suburban development pattern of homogenous land uses concentrated in neighborhoods and along transportation corridors.
ii.
Where appropriate, mixed land uses are allowed to promote a denser, urban development pattern.
iii.
The most prevalent land use in Jefferson Parish is the detached single-family home, which comprises many, quiet, well-maintained, and family-oriented neighborhoods.
iv.
The short-term rental of a home is a business that generally is not compatible with the homogenous residential character of many of the Jefferson Parish's neighborhoods.
v.
Subject to use standards, the short-term rental of a home is compatible in mixed-use and commercial areas where residential and nonresidential co-exist.
vi.
To promote health, safety, and the general welfare, and in accordance with the comprehensive plan, the amortization of existing short-term rentals, within a reasonable timeframe is necessary so these activities either cease operations where prohibited or come into compliance where allowed by the provisions of this Code.
2.
Purpose.The purposes of this section are to:
i.
Provide an adequate timeframe for operators of short-term rentals allowed as permitted uses by-right to come into compliance with the standards and approval and licensing requirements provided for in this Code; and
ii.
Establish a fair and equitable process for the elimination of short-term rentals existing prior to the adoption date of [the ordinance from which this section derives] and prohibited by new regulations.
3.
Amortization. Any short-term rental operating prior to [date of adoption of ordinance] shall have either twelve (12) months to cease operations or six (6) months to compliance with standards, from said date to come into compliance with one of the following, as applicable:
i.
If located in a zoning district where short-term rental is prohibited, shall cease operations. During the twelve (12)-month period, the short-term rental shall be considered a nonconforming use and shall not be required to adhere to the standards set forth in section 40-752(e)(7). However, upon termination of the amortization period, the short-term rental shall cease operation immediately.
ii.
If located in a zoning district where short-term rental is permitted by-right, the short-term rental shall have six (6) months to come into compliance with the standards set forth in section 40-752(e)(7), including all required licenses.
d.
Long-term rental. Nothing in these short-term rental provisions is intended to apply to or prohibit the long term rental of a dwelling unit for thirty (30) or more consecutive days and where typically the method of rental involves an extended period of time and tenant obligations such as payment of utility bills in the name of the tenant.
