(a)
If any property owner has been notified by the director of the department of public works as provided in section 29-151 and has an objection to the construction or repair of a sidewalk or desires an extension of time within which to perform such work, he may request such extension or raise whatever objection by filing same with the director; all such requests shall contain a written statement in affidavit form indicating the reasons for the owner's objection and/or need for an extension of time.
(b)
Upon request by an owner, the director may grant an extension of time, not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, when an unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty exists; such extension may be renewed only once for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days.
(c)
In deliberating on any such request for an extension of time, the director shall consider whether or not:
(1)
The extension, if granted will be detrimental to the public welfare or seriously affect or be injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the applicant's property is located; and the director shall not grant approval unless either of the following conditions exist;
(2)
Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district; and the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the intentional actions of the applicant or any other person who may have or had interest in the property; and the strict adherence to the regulation for the property would result in a demonstrable hardship upon the owner as distinguished from mere inconvenience; or
(3)
Literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this article, and granting the variance requested will generally not confer on the applicant any special privilege which is denied by this article to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district or similarly situated, and the purpose of the waiver is not based exclusively upon a desire to serve the convenience or profit of the property owner or other interested party.
(d)
Upon denial or at the expiration of a temporary waiver, or waivers, as provided hereinabove, any property owner seeking further relief may do so by application to the council.

The council may, in its discretion, grant exemptions of installation of sidewalks to entire single-family residential subdivisions when it determines such sidewalks are not warranted. If any exemption, pursuant to this section, is granted to such subdivisions situated in whole or in part in zoning districts other than R-1 single-family, such exemption shall only apply to lots used for single-family residences and only when title restrictions are imposed by the owner restricting such lots to single-family residences.
Nothing contained in this section shall authorize the exemption of sidewalks which are mandated by the provisions of section 29-146(c).

(a)
Sidewalks shall be constructed of poured-in-place Portland cement concrete having a minimum compressive strength of two thousand five hundred (2,500) pounds per square inch in twenty-eight (28) days. All poured-in-place concrete sidewalks constructed for residential dwellings shall had a minimum thickness of four (4) inches. All other poured-in-place concrete sidewalks shall have a minimum thickness of five (5) inches.
In areas zoned for single-family dwellings, brick pavers or concrete pavers are an acceptable substitute for poured-in-place concrete. Pavers may be set in mortar over a rigid three-inch thick (minimum) concrete base or, in areas of poor soil, set without mortar on a four-inch thick (minimum) sand base to facilitate periodic adjustment to correct problems caused by soil subsidence.
(b)
All sidewalks shall have a minimum width of four (4) feet and shall be constructed within the sidewalk space at a distance of one (1) foot from the property line. In cases where a narrow sidewalk space is supplemented by an adjoining servitude, the sidewalk shall be placed in the servitude, one (1) foot from the servitude line. Upon request by a property owner, the director of public works may authorize placement of the sidewalk at a different location within the sidewalk space or servitude.
(c)
Sidewalks constructed of poured-in-place Portland cement concrete shall have contraction joints scored or saw-cut to a depth of three-fourths (¾) of an inch at four-foot intervals. Expansion joints shall be placed at maximum intervals of twenty (20) feet. All sidewalk intersections at street corners shall be bounded by expansion joints. Expansion joints shall consist of one-half-inch or three-fourths-inch thick premoulded expansion material or three-fourths-inch thick treated timber. Expansion joints must completely separate adjoining concrete slabs. There shall be no concrete-to-concrete contact at an expansion joint. Expansion joints must have a minimum of three (3) No. 10 common galvanized nails projecting completely through the expansion material into the concrete on each side of the joint. The nails act as mini dowels to hold expansion material in place and prevent vertical displacement of adjoining slabs. Sidewalk expansion joints and edges shall be rounded with an edging tool having a one-half-inch radius.
(d)
All newly constructed or reconstructed sidewalks at corner locations shall include a curb ramp for the handicapped which provides gently sloped access to the street from the sidewalk, and vice versa, for elderly and physically disabled persons.
(e)
Curb ramps for the handicapped shall be constructed in accordance with plans and specifications available from the department of engineering or with other plans which have been approved by the director of engineering. The slope of the ramp shall be no greater than eight (8) percent. This equals approximately nine and one-half (9½) inches in ten (10) feet. Since construction of a curb ramp requires modification of existing curb on the street, plans for curb ramps must be approved by the director of engineering.
(f)
Sidewalks constructed of brick or concrete pavers set in mortar are rigid structures; therefore, they must utilize the same type of joints and joint spacing requirements as for poured-in-place concrete sidewalks. Expansion joint material must be flush with top surface of pavers. The scoring of joints will apply to concrete base. It is desirable that an unmortared joint be left between the pavers at each scored joint to control reflective cracking.
(g)
Sidewalks constructed of brick pavers or concrete pavers over a sand base do not require special joints of any type since, in effect, a joint exists between each paver. After pavers are set, sweep sand over surface to fill voids in joints between pavers.
(h)
Standard brick and concrete pavers have no holes and are generally twice as long as they are wide to obtain the greatest variety of patterns. Dimensions should be approximately eight (8) inches long, approximately four (4) inches wide and approximately two (2) inches thick, Regular brick, without holes, may be substituted for pavers, but the variety of patterns will be limited if their length is not twice their width.
(i)
Pavers will require 2 × 6 treated timber edge restraints, set on edge, four (4) feet apart, to establish sidewalk with and keep the pavers from separating. The top of the 2 × 6 must be approximately one (1) inch below finished grade of sidewalk, Edge restraint timbers should be purchased in lengths of eight (8) or ten (10) feet for ease in handling. Edge restraints must be anchored in place with pointed 2 × 4 treated timber stakes, twelve (12) to fifteen (15) inches long, spaced approximately four (4) feet apart and nailed to the 2 × 6 with No. 8 or No. 10 common galvanized nails. The tops of stakes must be approximately one (1) inch below the top of the edge of the restraint.
(j)
The compacted sand base between edge restraints must be at least four (4) inches deep. Compaction is achieved by saturating with water, At driveway locations, the compacted sand base must be at least six (6) inches deep.
(k)
It shall be unlawful to construct a sidewalk in the sidewalk space or adjoining servitude until the alignment and elevation thereof have been established by the department of engineering.
(l)
All sidewalks constructed in the sidewalk space or adjoining servitude must comply with the specifications provided herein and any plans and specifications that the department of public works may, by rule, require. The department of engineering will provide standard plans to supplement these specifications, upon request.
