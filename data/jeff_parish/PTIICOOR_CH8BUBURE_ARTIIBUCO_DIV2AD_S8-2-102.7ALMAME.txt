The provisions of the technical codes are not intended to prevent the use of any material or method of construction not specifically prescribed, provided any such alternate has been reviewed by the code official, approved in writing and officially recorded with the application for permit in the records of the department. The code official may approve any such alternate, provided the code official finds that the alternate for the purpose intended is at least the equivalent of that prescribed in the technical codes, in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety. The code official shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted to substantiate any claim made regarding the adequacy of such alternate. If, in the opinion of the director, the evidence and proof are not sufficient to justify approval or recommendation for an amendment, the applicant may refer the entire matter to the board of standards and appeals as specified in section 8-2-105 of this chapter.
