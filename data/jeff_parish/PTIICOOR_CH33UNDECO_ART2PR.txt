Any proposed land use or development shall comply with the procedures of this UDC. Development approvals are required for all development, unless otherwise excepted, to ensure compliance with adopted codes, standards, and regulations, and to ensure consistency with the comprehensive plan and policies of the parish. This division describes procedures that are common to multiple types of applications. Reference is made to the appropriate section of this Code when procedures and requirements of a particular application are addressed elsewhere. Generally, the procedures for all applications have five (5) common elements:
(1)
Submittal of a complete application, including required fee payment and appropriate information;
(2)
Determination of the category of development approval and review of the submittal by appropriate staff, agencies, and boards;
(3)
A recommendation, if applicable, and a decision to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application;
(4)
If necessary, amending or appealing the decision; and
(5)
Recording the decision.

Pursuant to this article and as described in Table 33-2.3-1, development approvals comprise three (3) basic categories: legislative (L), quasi-judicial (Q), and ministerial (M).
(1)
A legislative development approval requires action by the parish council and includes, but is not limited to, a UDC or zoning text amendment, rezoning, conditional use permit, or major subdivision, all of which require a public hearing.
(2)
A quasi-judicial development approval, which requires a public hearing and entails procedural due process requirements, involves the application of a discretionary standard required by this Code. An example is a variance granted by the board of zoning adjustments.
(3)
A ministerial development approval involves the application of the standards of this Code by an administrative official. A public hearing is not required, or, if required, has already been conducted and the development approval application ensures that the proposed use complies with the previously approved plat, plan, or zoning amendment. An example is the issuance of a building permit by the director of inspection and code enforcement. Administrative officials include, but are not limited to, the directors of planning and inspection and code enforcement.

(a)
Upon adoption of a resolution or introduction of an ordinance, the council may call for moratorium on development approvals affected by the proposed amendment or adopt interim development standards. Such moratorium or interim development standards shall be in effect from the date that a resolution is adopted or an ordinance is placed in summary for up to one (1) year or until the effective date of the ordinance, whichever occurs first. The council action shall not affect action on completed applications submitted prior to the resolution or ordinance, but may affect subsequent applications for the same project. When calling a study or invoking a moratorium, the Council may establish interim development standards providing for reasonable approval conditions or exemptions for certain types of development applications that would otherwise be affected by the study or moratorium. Introduction of an ordinance that conveys the substantial intent of the planning director's findings and recommendations for the final disposition of a study shall extend a moratorium or interim zoning regulations for an additional period not to exceed six (6) months or the effective date of final council action, whichever comes first.
(b)
The expiration of a moratorium or interim development standards shall not result in the expiration of a study. The planning director shall notify the council ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of a moratorium. At any time during the ninety (90) day period the council may extend the moratorium or interim development regulations by resolution or ordinance for no more than one (1) additional period not to exceed six (6) months. Upon the expiration of the moratorium no identical moratorium shall be imposed for a two (2) year period from the final expiration date of the expired moratorium.

This section applies to certain uses that because of unique characteristics or potential impacts on adjacent and nearby land uses, are not permitted as a matter of right but which may, under appropriate standards and factors, be approved. Compliance with the generally applicable requirements may not be sufficient, and additional measures and conditions may be necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed development. These uses shall be permitted through the issuance of a conditional use permit (CUP) within a site plan approved by the parish council after ensuring that the use can be appropriately accommodated on the specific property; that it will conform to the comprehensive plan; that it can be constructed and operated in a manner that is compatible with the surrounding land uses and overall character of the community; and that the public interest, health, safety, and general welfare will be promoted. For purposes of this Code, a special permitted use is the same as a conditional use.
(1)
Applicability. The conditional use permit procedures apply only to any conditional use permit authorized in this UDC. The provisions of this section apply to any application for approval of a conditional use enumerated by a "C" in the applicable use matrix. Conditional uses are those uses that may be compatible with the land uses permitted by right but that require individual review of their location, design, and configuration, and the imposition of conditions or mitigations in order to ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location within the zoning district.
(2)
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, agricultural, timber, natural resource exploration and extraction, and other resource based uses are permitted and authorized in undeveloped areas of the U-1S without the requirement of a conditional use permit until such time as those specific areas are approved for development by the council.
(3)
Initiation. An owner of real property in unincorporated Jefferson Parish or the owner's authorized applicant may apply for a CUP for that property by filing an application with the planning department. The application shall include the material required for a site plan in the Appendix of the UDC and shall provide substantial competent evidence in the form of data, reports, or impact assessments to support findings related to the suitability of the use.
(4)
Procedure and approval. When the planning director has determined that the application is complete, she shall forward the application to the LURTC for review and comment. After LURTC review, the planning director shall make findings and a technical recommendation regarding approval of the CUP and submit her findings and recommendation to the PAB and council in accordance with the procedures of subsections A, B, C, and D of section 33-2.21.4 Decision makers of this division. Pursuant to these procedures, a CUP shall require a public hearing. The planning director and PAB may concurrently process and review the CUP and its site plan with a concept plan, rezoning, or subdivision application for the same property. The council shall make the final decision regarding approval of the CUP and may concurrently take action on related applications for concept plan, rezoning, or subdivision.
(5)
Conditions. In approving any CUP, the council may:
a.
Impose such reasonable standards, conditions, or requirements, in addition to or that supersede any standard specified in this Code, or within federal or state regulations and standards if federal or state provisions allow additional or stricter application, as the Council may deem necessary to protect the public interest and welfare. Such additional standards may include, but are not be limited to:
1.
Availability and financing of adequate public facilities;
2.
Dedication or reservation of land;
3.
Impact fees;
4.
Creation of special assessment districts;
5.
Creation of restrictive covenants, easements, or servitudes;
6.
Special setbacks, yard or area requirements;
7.
Increased screening, landscaping, or buffering requirements;
8.
Development phasing;
9.
Standards pertaining to traffic, circulation, lighting, hours of operation, vibration, noise, odor, dust, smoke, gas, or other performance-related impact, or protection of environmentally sensitive areas and similar characteristics; and
10.
Provision of sustainable features;
b.
Require that a performance guarantee be posted and a development agreement be entered into by the applicant to ensure continued compliance with all conditions and requirements as may be specified, in accordance with article 2 procedures, division 4 development agreements of this UDC.
(6)
Approval criteria. A conditional use is permitted only if the applicant demonstrates that:
a.
The proposed use shall comply with all applicable regulations of this Code;
b.
The proposed use shall promote a high quality of development and will be compatible with existing development and development anticipated in the future, including recreational uses, public facilities, and open space resources.
c.
The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the proposed use shall not have adverse impacts on the health, safety, comfort, or general welfare of persons living or working in the area, and shall not be injurious to property or improvements in the area. In making such a determination, consideration shall be given to:
1.
The location, type, and height of buildings, structures, or facilities;
2.
The type and extent of landscaping, screening, and buffering on the site; and
3.
Whether the proposed use is consistent with the comprehensive plan, especially ones that encourage mixed uses or densities;
d.
The proposed use shall not be noxious or offensive by reason of vibration, noise, odor, dust, smoke, or gas;
e.
Adequate public facilities shall be provided as set forth in article 7, adequate public facilities required of this UDC;
f.
Adequate measures shall be taken to provide ingress, egress, and interior circulation so designed as to minimize traffic hazards and congestion on the public streets and facilitate safe and convenient multi-modal transportation for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists;
g.
The proposed use shall not impede the orderly development and improvement of surrounding property or the area;
h.
The public interest and welfare supporting the proposed use shall be sufficient to outweigh the individual interests that may be adversely affected by the establishment of the proposed use.
(7)
Subsequent applications. An application for CUP may be withdrawn at any time. If the application has been advertised for public hearing in compliance with the procedures of this UDC, an application requesting substantially the same use on all or part of the same described land shall not be reconsidered within one (1) year of withdrawal. No application for a CUP for any lot or parcel that requests the same use and same conditions shall be considered within one (1) year of a final decision denying the application.
(8)
Amendments. An amendment is a request for any enlargement, expansion, increase in intensity or density, relocation, or modification of any condition of a previously approved and currently valid CUP. Unless otherwise provided, amendments shall be processed as follows:
a.
Minor amendment. After review and comment from LURTC the planning director may approve a shift of five (5) percent or less, calculated cumulatively over what was approved in the initial CUP application, in the width, length, depth, or diameter of the location of a building, structure, or impervious surface to meet a foundation or similar study or accommodate a condition discovered during construction; or a five (5) percent or less increase in either building footprint, gross floor area, or impervious surface calculated cumulatively over what was approved in the initial CUP application; provided that such minor changes comply with the following criteria:
1.
No previous minor modification has been granted pursuant to this section;
2.
There will be no detrimental impact on any adjacent property caused by significant change in appearance or use of the property or any other contributing factor;
3.
The change does not involve the storage of hazardous, flammable, or toxic materials as determined by the fire director or chief;
4.
Nothing in the currently valid CUP precludes or otherwise limits such expansion or enlargement; and
5.
The proposal conforms to the requirements of this UDC, complies with all regulations of this Code, and is in keeping with the intent of the comprehensive plan.
b.
Major amendment. Any proposed amendment other than those provided in this section for minor amendment are considered a major amendment and shall be approved in the same manner and under the same procedures as are applicable to the issuance of the initial development approval.
(9)
Nonconforming uses. For an existing and currently valid conditional use that is no longer allowed as a conditional use in the zoning district in which it is located, the parish council, upon receipt of an application forwarded by the planning director, may review and approve an amendment to said development approval, provided that such amendment does not allow the use to be enlarged, expanded, increased in intensity, relocated, or continued beyond any limitation specified in the existing use development approval or established in Chapter 40, zoning, Article XXXVII nonconforming uses of this Code.
(10)
Recordation. A copy of all plans, agreements, ordinances, resolutions, or other documents associated with the authorization of a conditional use pursuant to this section shall be recorded at the expense of the applicant in the name of the property owner in the office of the Jefferson Parish Clerk of Court, pursuant to the procedures of section 33-2.25.4 Recordation of approved site plan of this UDC.
(11)
Renewal. Unless excepted in a zoning district or specific use standard, or otherwise provided, a conditional use shall be renewed every two (2) years subject to the provisions of section 40-764 Renewal of special permitted use in Article XL. special permitted uses of Chapter 40 zoning of this Code.

Site plans are intended to provide detailed information about the location, design, and configuration of proposed buildings, parking, access ways, landscaping, yards, and other features of site development. This information is needed to demonstrate compliance with applicable requirements for the location and type of development and is vital to ensure the continued health, safety, and welfare of the general public. Recognizing that administrative staff is capable of evaluating site plans as a matter of course in the review of development permits, that the land development regulations are specific in terms of their requirements, including which uses are subject to site plan review and in which zoning districts site plan review shall occur, that the need for a public hearing is reduced for most projects, and in accordance with law, the parish establishes a ministerial or staff procedure for site plan approval and provides a ministerial/quasi-judicial procedure and a legislative procedure for site plans that require a public hearing and action by the board of zoning adjustments or the parish council.

Unless otherwise provided in this Code, site plans shall be submitted to the planning department. The planning director shall forward the site plan to the LURTC for review and comment prior to action. Lack of findings from LURTC within ten (10) days shall be construed as no objection to approval. After evaluating LURTC comments and the site plan's compliance with applicable development standards, the planning director shall render a decision: 1) the application qualifies for ministerial development approval; 2) the application qualifies for ministerial/quasi-judicial development approval; or 3) the application is subject to legislative development approval.
(1)
Ministerial development approval. Unless otherwise provided in this Code, the planning director shall approve the site plan if it fully complies with the criteria and standards set forth in the applicable zoning district and other applicable sections of this UDC or chapters of this Code, or if it does not fully comply but has been granted a ministerial exception.
(2)
Ministerial/quasi-judicial development approval. If the standards of the zoning district or in other applicable sections of this Code authorize the board of zoning adjustments (BZA) to grant a variance or exception for criteria and standards and the applicant requests this quasi-judicial action, the planning director shall forward the application with a recommendation regarding approval to the BZA and shall withhold approval of the site plan until the BZA takes final action.
(3)
Legislative development approval. If the standards of the zoning district or in other applicable sections of this Code authorize the parish council to approve a concept or development plan, or grant a variance, waiver, or exception for criteria and standards and the applicant requests this legislative action, the planning director shall forward the application with a recommendation regarding approval to the Old Metairie Commission or the planning advisory board, as applicable, for a public hearing and recommendation and to the council for final action.
(4)
Submittal requirements. The application for site plan review shall include the information listed in the appendix of this UDC, unless additional information is required by the zoning district standards or other applicable sections of this Code, or the planning director finds, in writing, that specific information is not required or additional information is required to evaluate compliance with applicable development standards.
(5)
Effect of approval.
a.
The approved site plan, as indicated by the dated signature of the Council Chairperson or Planning Director, as applicable, shall govern development and use of the property until a new or amended site plan is approved. Until a site plan is approved, no building or structure shall be erected, added to, or structurally altered; no parking lot shall be paved, added to, or structurally altered; and, no building permit or certificate of completeness shall be issued. Any deviation from the approved site plan is a violation of this UDC.
b.
Final site plan approval shall be valid for a period of one (1) year, except that a phasing plan approved by the Council or Planning Director, as applicable, may provide for approval of discreet project phases over a period of up to three (3) years. Site plan approvals of longer than three (3) years may be authorized through Parish Council approval of a development agreement as provided in Division 4, Development Agreements, in this Article.
c.
If approval of the site plan lapses because no building permit has been issued or the building permit lapses and has not been reactivated, then the approved site plan shall be deemed null and void.

To facilitate flexibility in design while maintaining the health, safety, and welfare of the public, the planning director, upon consideration of LURTC comments, may grant ministerial exceptions, where specifically authorized by the Code, where the applicant demonstrates, through documentation based on generally accepted planning and urban design principles, that full compliance would be impracticable due to site or other physical constraints, or that an alternative approach would achieve the purposes of the standards without posing a threat to health and safety or degrading the general welfare.
(b)
Where the planning director does not grant a ministerial exception, the applicant may appeal the decision made by the planning director to the parish council. Upon consideration of the written report of the planning director, the council shall decide the appeal by adoption of a resolution and may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed as provided in the resolution.

(a)
Purpose and applicability. The concept plan is intended to ensure that proposed land uses, intensities, and street layouts are consistent with the comprehensive plan or applicable regulations. The concept plan is optional unless the applicant chooses to plat or develop contiguous land holdings in multiple phases. The concept plan is intended to provide assurance to the applicant and the parish that proposed land uses, development intensities, and street layouts are acceptable prior to or in conjunction with action on a preliminary plat. The concept plan also establishes a schedule for completion of multi-phased development.
(b)
Application and procedures.

(2)
The application, with all materials and information required in the appendix of this UDC, shall be filed with the planning director, who shall review the application for completeness and forward the application to the LURTC for findings and recommendations.
(3)
The application for concept plan approval may be filed, processed, and heard concurrently with the preliminary plat for all or a portion of the land shown within the concept plan. If the entire concept plan area is included in the preliminary plat, then the concept plan and preliminary plat shall be approved through the same ordinance. If the preliminary plat includes only a portion of the concept plan area, then the concept plan shall be approved by resolution and the preliminary plan shall be approved by ordinance.
(4)
Notice shall be mailed, published, and posted in conformance with common procedures of this UDC.
(5)
The planning director shall incorporate the LURTC findings and recommendations with that of staff and forward one recommendation to the PAB, which shall conduct a public hearing. The planning director shall forward his findings and recommendations and those of the PAB to the parish council.

(a)
Purpose. Subdivision waivers provide a mechanism for relief for property owners when strict application of this UDC would result in practical difficulties or a particular hardship to a property owner due to unique conditions of a property proposed to be subdivided. Waivers may be granted for lot dimensions and setbacks at the time of preliminary plat approval. The waiver granted shall be the minimum necessary to permit reasonable use of the land.
(b)
Applicability. Subdivision waivers to the provisions of this UDC may be requested when an applicant can demonstrate that the unique parcel shape, size, configuration or other conditions preclude compliance with this UDC.
(c)
Application and procedure. The application, with the required information as listed in the appendix of this UDC, shall be filed with the planning director. Subdivision waiver requests shall be requested in writing along with a plat application and processed concurrently with a preliminary plat application.
(d)
Required findings. A waiver is not a right. In conformance with State law, a waiver may be granted only upon finding that:
(1)
The property cannot be developed reasonably under the provisions of this UDC;
(2)
The requested waiver will not conflict with the purposes of this UDC or the comprehensive plan;
(3)
The hardship does not generally apply to other properties in the parish. Reasons for hardship may relate to the particular property, because of size, shape, topography, or other physical conditions, rather than personal circumstances;
(4)
If the applicant complies strictly with the provisions of this UDC, then the applicant will be unable to make reasonable use of the affected property;
(5)
The hardship does not exist because of conditions created by the owner or previous owners of the property;
(6)
Granting the requested waiver will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this UDC to other lands that are similarly situated and configured;
(7)
The granting of the waiver will not be contrary to the public interest, will not adversely affect property values, will not adversely affect other property in the vicinity, and will be in harmony with the intent and purpose of this UDC; and
(8)
The waiver requested is the minimum modification to this UDC necessary to alleviate the hardship.
(e)
Decision maker. Decisions on subdivision waivers to this UDC shall be made by the parish council. When a waiver to this UDC constitutes a waiver to multiple sections of this UDC, separate actions shall not be required to modify the provisions of each section. However, each waiver shall be cited in the ordinance approving the preliminary plat and shall be noted on the final plat.

If the applicant chooses not to complete all required on and off-site public improvements prior to final plat approval or issuance of the final certificate of compliance or completion, the applicant shall provide financial guarantees in favor of the parish to assure the construction of on- and off-site public improvements identified in the final plat or site plan approval and documented in the development agreement. This surety shall remain in effect for the duration of the agreement or until the parish has accepted all improvements. In the event the applicant is unable to complete the required improvements, and such improvements are deemed necessary for the preservation of the public health and safety, the parish may use the guarantee to complete the improvements as required or pursue other remedies authorized by state law.

The parish council may defer the requirement for the completion of required improvements if the applicant enters into a development agreement by which the applicant guarantees completion of all required public improvements no later than two (2) years following the date upon which the council approves the final plat or the department of inspection and code enforcement issues the final certificate of compliance or completion on the building permit for a site plan approved by the planning director or council. The parish council may authorize an agreement providing for multi-phase development over a longer period of time, provided that the agreement includes a phasing schedule and that provisions are made for guaranteeing completion of improvements required to serve each phase as it is subdivided or, in the case of a site plan, developed. The council may require the applicant to complete and/or dedicate some required public improvements, rights-of-way, or servitudes for subsequent development phases prior to approval of the final plat or issuance of the final certificate of compliance or completion for a site plan for any phase of a multi-phase development. For public improvements serving multiple developments the council may accept a pro rata contribution towards the funding of required public improvements. The parish attorney's approval of the form and legality of any development agreement is required prior to its execution. The public works director shall verify that improvement costs provided by the applicant reasonably reflect the costs of required improvements prior to execution of the development agreement.

(a)
Security required. Whenever the parish council permits an applicant to enter into a development agreement under this section, the applicant shall be required to provide sufficient security to ensure completion of the required public improvements. The security shall be in the form of performance bond, a trust agreement, a letter of credit, cash escrow, or a surety bond acceptable to the parish and naming the parish as the beneficiary and guaranteeing construction of subject improvements.
(b)
Amount of security. The performance bond, trust agreement, letter of credit, cash escrow, or surety bond shall be in an amount estimated by the public works director as reflecting one-hundred ten (110) percent of the cost of the improvements in the approved construction plan or site plan as calculated using prevailing wage rates, and shall be sufficient to cover all promises and conditions contained in the development agreement.
(c)
Performance bond. In addition to all other security, when the parish participates in the cost of an improvement, the applicant shall provide a performance bond from the contractor, with the parish as a co-obligee.
(d)

Best's Key Rating Guide to write individual bonds up to ten (10) percent of policyholder's surplus as shown in the A.M. Best's Key Rating Guide.
(e)
No surety company will be accepted as bondsman that does not have a permanent agent or representative in the State of Louisiana upon whom notices may be served. Service of notice on said agent or representative in the State of Louisiana shall be equal to service of notice on the president of the surety company or such other officer as may be concerned.
(f)
Should the applicant's surety, even though approved and accepted by Jefferson Parish, subsequently remove its agency or representative from the State of Louisiana or terminate its residency or license in this state or become insolvent, bankrupt, or otherwise fail, the applicant shall furnish a new bond by another company approved by Jefferson Parish at no cost to Jefferson Parish. The new bond shall be executed under the same terms and conditions as the original bond.
