In cases involving work for which a permit is required where the code official determines the proposed construction work and/or occupancy is hazardous, unique, highly specialized or outside the expertise of the departmental resources, the code official may depart from the normal submittal and permit fee requirements. The code official may decide additional personnel, engineers, architects, consultants or other professional expertise is necessary to complete a proper and competent review or evaluation. If the code official makes such a determination, he may acquire the expertise (in accordance with the provisions of section 8-2-104.12 of this chapter) necessary to perform proper evaluation. In these cases the code official will engage the professional assistance necessary to perform a competent and complete review, impose and collect the actual costs incurred by the department, the building permit fees, in full, and any applicable parish plan processing fee from the applicant before the permit is issued. A third party certification may be allowed provided the credentials of the third party are appropriate and acceptable to the code official.
