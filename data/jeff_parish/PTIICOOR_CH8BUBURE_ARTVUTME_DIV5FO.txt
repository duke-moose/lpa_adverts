Sec. 8-5-119.9.8. The area under footings, foundations, and concrete slabs on grade shall have all vegetation, stumps, roots, and foreign materials removed prior to their construction. Fill material shall be sanitary fill.
Sec. 8-5-119.9.9. Pile foundations shall be required for all structures, including any building, except those located in areas with soils designated Group A by the United States Department of Agriculture.
Exceptions:
Temporary structures with length of life specified, at the discretion of the code official.
One (1) story detached residential accessory buildings with an area not exceeding one thousand (1,000) square feet nor one (1) story in height.
Structures for which a complete soil analysis, prepared by a Louisiana Registered Civil Engineer, concludes that the proposed foundations are adequate to support the structure without excessive differential or overall settlement or movement.
Manufactured houses when installed in accordance with Louisiana R.S.51. Trailers or modular buildings used for commercial purposes provided a tie down method design in accordance with Section 1609, International Building Code. Lightweight aluminum canopies accessory to residential uses.
An addition to an existing structure may be allowed provided it can be shown that to place only the proposed construction on a different type of foundation would not cause excessive differential settlement or movement between the various sections of the completed structure. To prevent the possibility of differential settlement, it is recommended that the addition have similar spread footings or be supported on piles with lengths and loadings identical to the original. Due to the inherent qualities of many soils, subsidence may not be totally preventable; however, if foundations are designed and built according to good building standards, it should be possible to hold differential settlement to a minimum and within acceptable limits.
Sec. 8-5-119.9.10. Any person contemplating a foundation which may make use of, be adjacent to, or involve public property shall determine in advance of construction the existence of public or private underground or overhead utilities which may be occupying said public property. Such person shall secure proper approval from the public and private agencies concerned and shall observe all precautions necessary to avoid damage or disturbance to said utilities (telephone, fiber optic, coaxial, sewerage, drainage, water, gas, electricity and the like).

From the area thus obtained, the dead load soil pressure of such footing is determined and the areas of all other footings of the building shall be determined on the basis of their respective dead loads only and such dead load soil pressure. In no case shall the load per square foot under any portion of any footing, due to the combined dead, live, wind, and any other loads, exceed the safe sustaining power of the soil upon which the footing rests.

The allowable load capacity for a single pile shall be determined by a load test made under the direction of an accredited independent testing laboratory or a Louisiana Registered Civil Engineer. The load capacity for a single pile shall be established by any of the following methods:
Method 1—When the total test load applied equals twice the proposed load capacity for a single pile; it shall be left in place at least forty-eight (48) hours, the last twenty-four (24) hours of which shall be free from settlement. If, after deducting rebound following the total release of this load, the net settlement at the top of the pile does not exceed 0.01 inch per ton of total test load, the pile shall be considered adequate to support the proposed load capacity for a single pile.
Method 2—Where the pile is loaded to failure, the loading value where the load settlement curve begins to show an accelerated deviation from its previous trend may be considered the "yield point" for the given soil and pile, one-half (½) this value or one-half (½) the value at which the net settlement is estimated as one-half (½) inch, whichever is smaller, shall be considered as the load capacity for a single pile.
Method 3—The failure load of a pile, half of which shall be used as the load capacity for a single pile, shall be defined as that load which produces a settlement or movement of the tip equal to one-quarter (¼) inch. The movement of the tip can be determined by actual measurement or by either of the following two (2) load distribution cases, both involving the measurement of the butt movement. In each case, the failure load shall be defined as that load producing a movement of the butt equal to the elastic deflection of the pile under the failure load plus one-quarter (¼) inch.

When pile foundations are required, maximum design load capacities have been established for various types and embedment of piles. These values are tabulated for each area which requires pile foundations and is shown of the U.S. Soil Conservation Survey Maps of the East Bank of Jefferson Parish, September, 1977, and the West Bank of Jefferson Parish, September, 1978. In soil type (13) Sharkey Clay, a special foundation may be used in lieu of a pile supported foundation, provided the foundation design is prepared by or under the direct supervision of a Louisiana Registered Civil Engineer or Louisiana Registered Architect experienced in soil mechanics. Such drawings and specifications shall be designated per lot and square and be imprinted with the design professional's seal and the plans shall be approved by the Department of Inspection and Code Enforcement, prior to issuance of the building permit. (See Table #1814—Lightly Loaded Piles).

The standards of this Code regarding the need for a pile foundation or the maximum design load capacity for the particular type of pile may be superseded by a subsoil investigation which is performed in accordance with 1804 for a pile load test which is performed in accordance with 1805 provided the subsoil investigation or pile load test is located within a 150 foot radius of the proposed foundation for a single boring or pile test. This distance can be increased to a three hundred-foot radius for multi-soil borings or pile tests that recommend the same design load.
It is within the discretion of the code official to waive the distance requirement provided a written request, presented by a Louisiana Registered Civil Engineer experienced in soil mechanics, evidences soils similarity at greater distances and demonstrates just causes for the waiver.

Piles shall be properly held in line or adequately tied together at their butt ends by means of continuous reinforced concrete or equivalent construction. Pile butts shall be protected by a minimum of three (3) inches of concrete around their perimeter. All piles for a building or a structure shall extend to the same depth unless adequate provisions for a differential settlement within the building or structure have been made. The code official shall be notified by the party installing the piles at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of any pile driving. A notarized affidavit from the piling contractor is required to be submitted to the building section of the department of inspection and code enforcement by the owner or general contractor substantiating the number, type, size, and treatment and must also indicate that the piles driven are in accordance with the building code and the permit drawings. The code official may require a preservative treatment certificate from the pile supplier when deemed necessary.

  Note - Class 9 Piles shall have a minimum tip diameter of four and three-quarters (4¾) inches with a natural taper to the butt. Class 9 Piles may only be used for foundations of one (1) story residential accessory buildings one thousand (1,000) square feet or less in total area.
‡ Areas not specifically covered by the U.S. Soil Conservation Survey Maps, East Bank (September, 1977) and West Bank (September, 1978) shall require a subsoil investigation.

The use of pile capacities contained in this section shall be limited only to situations in which downdrag is not a significant factor. Design use of these capacities shall be limited to areas where fill is less than two (2) feet in thickness unless the area is brought to grade for an adequate period prior to driving piles. Recommended pre-load periods are as follows:
Fill Thickness Pre-Load
2 to 3 feet 2 to 3 months
3 to 4 feet 3 to 6 months
4 to 5 feet 6 to 9 months
  Specific considerations must be made for construction over filled canals, ditches, or unusual local conditions. The thickness of the fill shall be measured from the natural ground surface. This shall be determined with a minimum of five (5) elevations taken one (1) on each corner of the structure and one (1) in the middle of the structure.
