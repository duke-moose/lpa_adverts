All rates shall be calculated on forms prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission or, to the extent not inconsistent with FCC Rules or the Act, forms specified by the Jefferson Parish Council or the delegatee. Data shall be provided on paper as "hard copy" and in computer diskette form. Computer diskettes shall be provided in such of the spread-sheet formate offered by the FCC, including Microsoft DOS and Microsoft Windows as the parish president or his designee shall from time to time specify.

All rate justifications shall trace the applicable rates from September 1, 1993 through the then present date to and through any proposed changes and shall demonstrate the effect of any and all changes in, or to, channel line-ups and/or tiers and adjustments, revisions and/or clarifications to the calculations specified by the FCC and/or parish orders.
(5)
To the extent not inconsistent with the Communications Act and/or FCC Rules, the Jefferson Parish Council may, by resolution or otherwise, adopt rules and regulations prescribing the information, data and calculations (or supplemental information, data and calculations) which must be included as part of the cable operator's filing of the schedule of rates or a proposed increase.
(b)
In addition to information and data required by rules and regulations of the parish, a cable operator shall provide all information requested by the parish (including the parish president or his designated representative) in connection with the parish's review and regulation of existing rates for the basic cable service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in these rates. The parish president (or his designated representative) may establish deadlines for submission of the requested information and the cable operator shall comply with such deadlines. At the request of the parish president or his representative, the cable operator shall designate an individual at the cable operator's local office to serve as a contact liaison.

(d)
If franchisee holds one (1) or more franchises with entities other than the parish, (whether those franchises shall be for areas within the parish, contiguous with the parish or elsewhere), franchisee shall fully explain the accounting procedures utilized to segregate identifiable costs related to the franchise it holds from the parish with all other costs, whether related to other franchises on the parish or other parishes (or counties).

Franchisee shall have the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that no personnel, equipment or charged are improperly charged as costs of its franchise.

As part of each rate justification and/or notification, an officer of the franchisee shall sign under oath a prescribed statement to the effect that he certifies under the penalty of perjury that all factors required by the FCC and/or the parish to be considered in rates have been included; that all past and present costs included in the rates are verifiable with records on file at the franchisee's principal place of business in the parish; that there is a correct factual basis for all future projections; that all materials are accurate, complete and correct; and, that there is no misstatement of fact or material fact related to rates and/or channel tiering not stated in the request. The person certifying shall also attest under oath that the franchise is in full compliance with the FCC rules and the Act.

If this chapter, any rules or regulations adopted by the parish, or any request for information requires the production of proprietary information, the cable operator shall produce the information. However, at the time the allegedly proprietary information is submitted, a cable operator may request that specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. The request for confidentiality will be granted if the parish determines that the preponderance of the evidence shows that non-disclosure is consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, the Louisiana Open Records Act and other provisions of law. The parish shall place in a public file for inspection any decision that results in information being withheld.
(b)
Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld as proprietary with the parish. The requesting party shall notify the cable operator of any such request. The parish shall weigh the policy considerations favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in light of the facts of the particular case.
