Plans for all buildings requiring any fire resistive components shall indicate how required fire resistance ratings will be achieved for all structural members, walls, floor/ceilings, and roofs. Specific listed U.L. system designs shall be given. Details of how fire resistive integrity of the required systems will be maintained where membrane or through penetrations occur shall be provided. The plans shall also indicate, in sufficient detail, how the fire resistive integrity will be maintained where required fire resistant floors intersect exterior walls.
