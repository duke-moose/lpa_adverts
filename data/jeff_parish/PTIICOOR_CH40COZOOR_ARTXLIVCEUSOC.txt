After the effective date of this chapter, except as specifically provided in section 40-696 hereof, no change in the use or occupancy in an existing building shall be made, nor shall any new building be occupied for any purpose until a certificate of use or occupancy has been issued by the inspection and code enforcement director. Every certificate of use or occupancy shall show that the new use or occupancy complies with all provisions of this chapter pertaining to the district in which it is located. Pending the issuance of a regular certificate, a temporary certificate of use or occupancy may be issued for a period of not exceeding six (6) months during the completion of alterations or during partial occupancy of a building pending its completion. Such temporary certificate shall not be construed as in any way altering the respective right, duties or obligations of the owners or of the parish relating to the use or occupancy of the premises or any other matter covered by this ordinance, and such temporary certificate shall not be issued except under such restrictions and provisions as will adequately insure the safety of the occupancy, provided that no certificates of use or occupancy be issued pending amendment or change of any district as provided further in Article XLVIII, Changes and Amendments, hereof.
