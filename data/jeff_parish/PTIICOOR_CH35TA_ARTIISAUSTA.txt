Annotations—Where parish by ordinance approved exemptions from local sales and use taxes of hotels from which district was authorized to collect occupancy tax, and district had acquired absolute right to the tax for at least five (5) years and tax was pledged to discharge obligations of the district, parish ordinances repealing action which abated the tax for the benefit of the district violated constitutional provision that no law impairing obligation of contracts or divesting vested rights should be passed. Hilton Hotels Corporation, 247 So.2d 843 (La. 1971).  Letter signed by parish council stating that parish sales tax did not apply to sale of services performed on tangible personal property imported into the parish and then exported to an owner outside the parish was of no effect on liability of taxpayers which repaired baking pans and sheets for customers most of whom were not located in the parish, nor did exemptions for services performed outside the parish or for interstate commerce apply.
