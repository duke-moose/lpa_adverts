To fill a vacancy in the position of any officer, director or other employee of Jefferson Parish or any of its subsidiaries who would otherwise, under applicable statutes, ordinances, resolutions or provisions of the Jefferson Parish Charter or other applicable law, require approval of the Jefferson Parish Council for such appointment to become effective, the parish president may make temporary appointments for such positions without the approval of the Jefferson Parish Council, but only under the following conditions and restrictions:
(1)
The temporary appointment shall be effective for no more than three (3) months from the date of the appointment, unless the council does approves an extension of such appointment under the provisions of subsection (2) herein.
(2)
The Jefferson Parish Council by resolution may extend the term of any temporary appointment for a period of up to an additional three (3) months beyond the original three-month term of such appointment.
(3)
Should the parish president fail to remove any person he has appointed whose appoint has not been confirmed by the council within the time limits imposed by this section, the council may by the adoption of appropriate measures remove from the parish's budget the funding for the position to which said person has been appointed.
(4)
For purposes of this section, the term "temporary appointment" shall mean any appointment made by the parish president without the approval of the Jefferson Parish Council, including, but not limited to, any acting, interim or ad hoc appointment, for any position for which the approval of the Jefferson Parish Council is required for such appointment to become effective.

(a)
Subject to the availability of unencumbered appropriated funds, the parish will indemnify and save harmless any parish officer or employee against any and all claims, demands, suits, and judgments of sums of money instituted by or awarded in favor of any third person growing out of, resulting from, or incurred by reason of any good faith act and/or omission of the officer or employee in connection with the lawful discharge or performance of his/her duties as an officer or employee of the parish, expressly excluding any acts or omissions which constitute gross negligence, recklessness, or an intentional tort or wrong, and expressly excluding any criminal proceedings which result in a conviction for an offense or which result in a grant of immunity from prosecution.
(b)
In civil actions, parish employees will be entitled to legal representation in the defense of the allegations and claims made in any lawsuit covered by subsection (a) of this section. Such defense will be provided at no cost to the parish officer or employee. Representation will generally be provided by the parish attorney's office. However, in the judgment of the parish attorney or of a court, when certain circumstances warrant that the interests of the parish and/or officer or employee would be better served through the acquisition of private counsel, the law department will relinquish its defense obligations in favor of a private attorney provided at the parish's expense, for reasonable and customary fees approved by the parish attorney, with said parish attorney having the option to be co-counsel of record.

(a)
A parish officer or employee may request the use of private counsel for the defense of a lawsuit when he/she is sued personally and would be held personally liable for payment of any damages awarded in an unfavorable judgment.
(b)
Before an officer or employee employs private counsel, he/she must obtain prior written approval from the parish attorney's office. Failure to obtain such prior written approval may result in imposition of the responsibility for payment of legal fees and costs upon the officer or employee. (See subsection (e) of this section.) Even when such approval is granted, the employee may have to pay for initial retainer fees and other expenses before being reimbursed by the parish for these amounts.
(c)
The parish attorney's office will coordinate the defense of all cases. An officer's or employee's appointing authority should forward to the law department photocopies of any petitions or other papers in a lawsuit in which the parish and/or any of its former or current employees are involved immediately upon receipt of these documents.
(d)
It is the officer's or employee's responsibility to notify his/her appointing authority of any actual or potential litigation and of any action or development in existing litigations as soon as he/she becomes aware of the same.
(e)
If private counsel is obtained by an officer or employee without the prior written consent of the law department or if an officer or employee violates the rules of subsections (f) and (g) of this section, then the employee will be solely responsible for the payment of all attorney's fees and costs and other expenses. Additionally, the parish in such a case will not be obliged to indemnify and save the officer or employee harmless from any judgment or other liability incurred by the officer or employee or his/her private attorney. The law department may grant exemptions from the application of this rule if subsequent approval for the hiring of private counsel is issued and if the law department finds that the failure to obtain prior approval has not prejudiced the parish's interest.
(f)
The officer or employee who is represented by private counsel should keep a log of all services rendered by the private counsel and of any meetings or correspondence. These records will assist the parish in the payment of reasonable and customary costs of the officer's or employee's representation by private counsel.
(g)
To the extent that the law permits and with due regard for the fundamental rights of the officers and employees of the parish, each officer or employee involved in civil litigation shall be obliged to cooperate as much as is reasonably possible with the parish and its attorneys in the defense of civil litigation.

(a)
Parish officers and employees will be indemnified for reasonable attorney's fees and costs reasonably incurred in the course of appearance or involvement in criminal proceedings, whether as a witness, suspect, or defendant, provided the appearance or involvement arises out of, results from, or is incurred by reason of any good faith act and/or omission of the officer or employee in connection with the lawful discharge or performance of his/her duties as an officer or employee of the parish, expressly excluding any acts or omissions which constitute gross negligence, recklessness, or an intentional tort or wrong, and expressly excluding any criminal proceedings which result in a conviction for an offense or which result in a grant of immunity from prosecution. Such indemnification will be made only if and when:
(1)
The officer or employee has been found innocent of all charges by a court;
(2)
A grand jury has returned "no true bill" when it considers indictment of the officer or employee;
(3)
The criminal proceeding has been terminated for a year or more and no criminal charges have been brought against the officer or employee or a court has dismissed all charges in advance of trial for want of probable cause or for some other reason which supports the presumed innocence; or
(4)
The appropriate prosecutorial authority has certified in writing that the officer or employee is or has been involved in a criminal proceeding as a witness merely, is not a suspect, potential defendant, or uncharged co-conspirator, and that there is no probable cause for prosecution.
(b)
The reasonableness of attorney's fees and costs and whether and to what extent they were reasonably incurred shall be determined by the parish attorney, after consultation with the chief administrative officer.
