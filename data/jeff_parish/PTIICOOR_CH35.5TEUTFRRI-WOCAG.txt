(a)
As fair and reasonable compensation for the occupancy by the grantee of the public rights-of-way and other property owned by the parish (referred to jointly as "parish property") for the construction, operation, maintenance, and the reconstruction of a telecommunications system within the parish, the value of such rights and privileges granted by the franchise, the fact that the public rights-of-way contain limited and finite capacity, the administration of the franchise by the grantor, the usage and interference with the public's use of public rights-of-way, the reduction in the useful life of the public rights-of-way and other parish property and other costs and obligations undertaken by the grantor herein, the grantee shall pay to the grantor an annual compensation (also referred to herein as "franchise fee"), to be calculated as stated below:
(1)
a.
Only long distance network service systems. For telecommunications systems providing only long distance network service ("only long distance network service"), the minimum franchise fee to be paid by grantee to grantor shall be two dollars and sixty cents ($2.60) per year per each linear foot of Parish property occupied by grantee's system not to exceed an area of one (1) contiguous cubic foot per each linear foot (referred to as "the system route"). If grantee's telecommunications system will occupy more than one (1) contiguous cubic foot of Parish property on any linear foot of the system route, the annual franchise fee shall be increased by an additional two dollars and sixty cents ($2.60) for each additional contiguous cubic foot and part thereof per each such linear foot of the system route. Such rates shall be referred to herein collectively as "footage rates."
b.
If after the franchise has been granted, grantee desires to increase the amount of parish property occupied by its telecommunications system beyond either the linear foot usage or contiguous cubic foot usage, or both, initially approved under the franchise, grantee shall apply to the parish for such an increase. Upon approval of such an increase the annual franchise fee shall be increased to reflect that increase according to the footage rates stated in subsection (a)(1)a., immediately above. parish approval for an increase in the use of the public rights-of-way shall not be unreasonably withheld.
c.
All franchise fees shall be increased annually by the U.S. City Average twelve-month percentage increase, if any, in the All Urban Consumers—All Items Index (CPI-U) as compiled by the U. S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (or its functional successor); no decreases shall apply. The CPI-U increase shall first be applied on January 1st following the first anniversary of the date grantee's franchise was accepted pursuant to section 35.5-13 of this article and then on each following January 1st during the term of the franchise. The CPI-U increase shall likewise apply to the cumulative franchise fee including increased usage assessments, if any, and to all CPI-U increases.
d.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum annual compensation based on footage rates for an only long distance network service telecommunications system which leases seventy-five (75) percent or more of its network footage from other parish franchise grantees shall be twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00).
(2)
a.
All others. For all other telecommunications service providers systems other than only long distance network service systems, including but not limited to local competitive exchanges, the annual compensation, i.e., franchise fee payable to grantor, shall be five (5) percent of grantee's gross receipts from the operation of the telecommunications system within the parish or the footage rates outlined in (a)(1)a. and (a)(1)b., immediately above, for the occupation of parish property by grantee's telecommunications system, whichever is greater on an annual basis as calculated at the end of the last quarter of each year.
b.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum annual franchise fee based on footage rates for a telecommunications services system which is not an "only long distance network service" shall be twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00). However, any year in which five (5) percent of such a grantee's gross receipts from the operation of its telecommunications system within the unincorporated areas of the Parish of Jefferson exceeds twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) and all CPI-U increases, the franchise fee shall be five (5) percent of such a grantee's gross receipts from the operation of its telecommunications system within the parish.
c.
The provisions in (a)(1)c., above regarding the annual CPI-U increase shall apply cumulatively to the annual fee calculated on footage rates including the franchise fee for increased footage assessments, if any, and to all CPI-U increases and to all maximum franchise fees in this chapter.
d.
For any year in which five (5) percent of grantee's gross receipts exceeds the per foot usage rates or the twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) maximum including CPI-U increase(s), grantee shall be credited with the amount of the per foot usage fee advance payment to grantor for that year, and grantee shall pay to grantor the amount by which five (5) percent of grantee's gross receipts exceeds the per foot usage payments by grantee for that year.
(3)
Miscellaneous general financial provisions.
a.
Payments. All payments calculated by the per foot usage rates, other than the initial annual franchise fee which is due upon grantee's acceptance of the franchise, are due and payable one (1) year in advance and shall be paid annually by January 1 of each year. Payments calculated on a gross receipts basis are payable quarterly, within thirty (30) days after the end of the preceding calendar quarter. Payments shall be by check made payable to the parish. If any payment is not received by the due date, grantee shall add to its payment a late penalty in the amount of ten (10) percent of the amount due. Additionally, interest in the amount of ten (10) percent per annum shall accrue on all payments and penalties until paid in full.
(4)
Nature of franchise fee. The compensation and other payments to be made pursuant to the franchise are in addition to any and all taxes and fees or charges which the grantee or any affiliated person shall be required to pay to the grantor or to any other governmental authority. Neither the grantee nor any affiliated person shall have or make any claim for any deduction or other credit of all or any part of the amount of compensation or other payments made pursuant to the franchise against any other fees or charges, including ad valorem taxes and/or any taxes which the grantee or any affiliated person is required to pay to the grantor.

(a)
Franchise security. No later than the date of the grantee's execution of the acceptance of the franchise, the grantee shall (1) deposit into a bank account, established by the Parish of Jefferson and maintain on deposit through the term of the franchise, the sum of up to one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00); or, (2) post a performance bond in accordance with the applicable procedures, in an amount of up to one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00); the bond shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be cancelled by the surety nor any intention not to renew be exercised by the surety until sixty (60) days after receipt by the Parish of Jefferson, by registered or certified mail, of written notice of such intent;" or (3) provide such other guaranty, instruments, letter of credit or security, which is acceptable to the grantor. Said franchise security shall be established in an amount of up to one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), unless a different amount is specified in the franchise and have a value sufficient to effectuate the following purposes:
(1)
The faithful performance by the grantee of all the provisions of the franchise; and
(2)
Compliance by grantee with all orders, permits and directions of any agency of the grantor having jurisdiction over grantee's acts or defaults pursuant to this Act; and
(3)
The payment by the grantee of any claims, liens, fees and/or taxes due the grantor which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system.
The maintenance of such security shall be a continuing obligation of grantee until the grantee has satisfied all of its obligations with the grantor that may have arisen from the acceptance of the franchise by the grantee or from its exercise of any privilege or right granted thereby. Posting the security for the franchise does not fulfill the separate requirements for a completion and restoration bond that may be required for the issuance of a utility construction permit for construction related to a franchise.
(b)
Failure to pay. If the grantee: (1) fails to pay to the grantor any fees due and unpaid; or (2) fails, after ten (10) days notice, to repay to the grantor any damages, costs or expenses which the grantor shall be compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of the grantee in connection with the franchise; or (3) fails to pay the grantor any fees due as a result of any transactions which have the effect of circumventing payment of such required fees and/or the evasion of any such payment by non-collection or non-reporting of gross receipts, bartering, or any other means which evades the actual collection of revenues for business pursued by the grantee; or d) fails, after thirty (30) days notice of such failure, to comply with any provisions of the franchise which the grantor reasonably determines can be remedied by any expenditure of security fund; grantor may withdraw from the security fund or demand payment on the bond, guaranty, instrument, letter of credit or security of a sufficient sum in satisfaction of same.
(c)
Restoration of security. Within thirty (30) days after notice to grantee that any amount has been withdrawn by the grantor from the security fund or other franchise security pursuant to this section, the grantee shall deposit a sum of money sufficient to restore such security fund, or otherwise replenish the franchise security in whatever form it was posted, to the original amount.
(d)
Return upon expiration. In the event that the franchise is terminated by reason of default by grantee, to the extent that such default is for non-payment of any amount due and payable pursuant to the franchise, an amount of the security fund equal to the amount of the non-payment shall become the property of the grantor. The grantee, however, shall be entitled to the return of such security fund, or portion thereof, as remains on deposit at the expiration of the term of the franchise, or upon termination of the franchise at an earlier date, provided that there is then no outstanding default on the part of the grantee.
(e)
Rights of grantor. The rights reserved to the grantor with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the grantor whether reserved by this article or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the grantor may have.
(f)
Construction bond. Grantor may require a reasonable construction bond from grantee based on the length and type of construction (aerial or underground).
(g)
Hold harmless. The grantee shall hold the grantor harmless for all damages and penalties suffered as a result of, or arising out of, the grantee's negligent use, installation, maintenance, repair and/or operation of a telecommunications system or a telecommunications system providing long distance network service whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by the franchise. This provision is not intended to create liability for the benefit of third parties but is solely for the benefit of the grantor and the grantee. In the event any claim is made against the parish that falls under this, section and a court of competent jurisdiction should adjudge, by final decree, that the grantor is liable therefor, the grantee shall indemnity and hold the grantor harmless of and from any such judgment or liability, including any court costs, expenses, and attorney fees incurred by the grantor in defense thereof. Upon commencement of any proceeding at law or in equity against the grantor relating to or covering any matter covered by this section, wherein the grantee has agreed, by accepting the franchise, to indemnify and hold the grantor harmless, or to pay said final judgment and costs, as the case maybe, the grantor shall give the grantee immediate notice of such suit or proceedings brought in connection therewith, and pay as aforesaid, any final judgment or judgments that may be rendered against the grantor by reason of such damage suit. Upon failure of the grantee to comply with the "defense of suit" provisions of this franchise, after reasonable notice to it by the grantor, the grantor shall have the right to defend the same and in addition to being reimbursed for any such judgment that may be rendered against the grantor, together with all court costs incurred therein; the grantee shall further reimburse the grantor for attorney's fees, including those employed by the grantor in such case or cases, as well as all expenses incurred by the grantor by reason of undertaking the defense of such suit or suits, whether such suit or suits are successfully defended, settled, compromised, or fully adjudicated against the grantor.
(h)
Defense expense. The grantee shall pay all expenses incurred by the grantor in defending itself with regard to all damages and penalties mentioned in subsection (g) above and for all claims against grantor arising out of the franchise. These expenses shall include all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, such as attorney fees, and shall also include the reasonable value of any services rendered by any employee of the grantor. In the event the grantor is compelled to undertake the defense of ant such suit by reason of the grantee's failure to perform as here and above provided, the grantor shall have the full right and authority to make or enter into any settlement or compromise of such adjudication as the parish attorney shall deem in the best interest of the grantor, this without the prior approval or consent of the grantee with respect to the terms of such compromise or settlement. Grantee need not indemnify, defend or hold grantor harmless for the tortious acts or omissions of the grantor, its officers, agents or employees.

All policies shall be endorsed to give the grantor at least thirty (30) days written notice of the intent by either the grantee or the insurer to amend or cancel the police.

As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings assigned in this article, unless the context clearly requires a different meaning:
Council shall mean the parish council or its successor as the governing authority of the Parish of Jefferson.
Date of revocability shall mean the date, past, present or future, whether determined precisely or described with reference to conditions or contingencies, upon which it first was, is, or will be lawful and just, in consideration of all the matters pertinent to making a determination of revocability, to revoke and terminate any right a respondent may have or claim to have to use the public rights-of-way for other than generally-permitted purposes, or to prohibit said respondent from using the public ways for other than generally-permitted purposes, or both.
Determination of revocability shall mean a finding by a hearing officer or, on appeal from said hearing officer, by the council, that a franchise agreement or other right by which a respondent claims entitlement to use the public ways for other than generally-permitted purposes is either ineffective, revocable at will or revocable upon reasonable notice to the respondent. In making such a determination, the hearing officer and/or council shall consider any and all pertinent information submitted to it, the argument and opinions of legal counsel and the totality of all relevant circumstances including (in the case of a contract or right that is revocable upon reasonable notice) the duration of the agreement or right, the pertinent investments of the respondent, the returns on such investment, and pertinent schedules or models for the depreciation or amortization of the equipment, facilities and plant in which the respondent has invested in reliance on or as a consequence of said agreement or right, the time which respondent might need to remove such plant, etc., in an orderly and efficient manner, the time needed to prevent disruption of the public health, welfare, safety or convenience, and the need for reasonable good faith negotiations with the parish for a new franchise or for a renewal revision or extension of an existing agreement.
Franchise shall mean the authority granted by parish ordinance to any public utility, or similar entity, to occupy public rights-of-way and other property owned by the parish for the franchisee's use, installation, maintenance and/or repair of telecommunications systems, data transmission systems, cable television systems, electrical systems, or natural gas systems or any other system related to the provision of services or products to the public for which a franchise may be awarded by the parish. Each franchise shall consist of referenced specifications, rates and other related material specific to the type of service or product provided by the franchisee.
Generally-permitted purposes shall mean lawful uses of the public rights-of-way which do not require a franchise or other similar grant of special authority to a particular grantee and which do not require the placement of equipment, fixtures and plant, and/or other physical facilities in, on, over or under the public ways. Generally-permitted purposes include, but are not limited to, passage, walking, and driving a vehicle, where not prohibited; carriage, and/or drayage not involving rails, poles, cables or other fixtures; lawful parades and processions, but shall not include any obstruction or constriction of public ways, obstruction of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, excavating or cutting of public ways, nor destruction of, damage to, or cutting or trimming of trees, shrubs, or other vegetation in, on, under or over a public rights-of-way.
With respect to a particular respondent only, in the context of a particular initiating report, ordinance of revocation, termination, and prohibition, investigation resolution, investigative proceedings, and/or determination provided for and governed by this article, and for no other purpose, "generally-permitted purposes" shall be deemed to include any purpose specifically authorized by another franchise and/or another similar instrument or right under which the same person or firm claims an entitlement to use the public ways that arises from or under said other franchise, instrument, or right and not under the particular franchise, instrument, or right that is part of the subject matter of said report, proposed or adopted ordinance, resolution, investigative proceedings, and/or determination. However, any such other franchise, instrument, or right may be made the subject of the same or of another report, ordinance, resolution, investigation, and/or other matter under this article, and if it and any entitlement which a respondent claims by or under it is thus made the subject of any such matter, the uses of the public rights-of-way which said respondent claims are thereby permitted shall not be deemed "generally-permitted purposes" for purposes of said matter.
Initiating report shall mean a written report filed by the parish president, the chairman of the council, the parish attorney or by a special counsel retained by the parish, which, identifies a respondent and which states that there are substantial legal issues as to whether respondent is entitled to use the public rights-of-way for any purposes other than generally-permitted purposes, whether respondent is entitled to use the public rights-of-way for a purpose or use for which he is in fact using same, or whether any purported franchise or similar right claimed by respondent is or will soon be subject to lawful revocation or termination.
Parish shall mean the Parish of Jefferson.
Public rights-of-way shall mean any public road, street, alley, avenue, boulevard, thoroughfare, sidewalk, lane, neutral ground, median, or other public way or portion thereof; any public square, playground, common or green space, park or similar public property, located within the limits of the parish.
Respondent shall mean a person or firm who for purposes of profit, gain, or business or commerce, or for the provisions of a service for a fee, has been and/or is using the public ways or public rights-of-way in the parish for other than generally-permitted purposes and who has placed, is placing or intends to place poles, lines, wires, cables, conduit, pipes, tracks, rails, elevators, conveyor belts, flues, chutes, privately owned bridges or walkways or flues, tunnels, or other plant, equipment, fixtures, or other physical facilities in, on, under, and/or over said public ways or other public property.

(2)
The respondent notifies the parish in writing that it accepts the terms of the pending proposed ordinance of revocation, termination, and prohibition;

Significant substantive amendments of said administrative rules and regulations shall not become effective unless and until approved by a resolution of the parish council. However, procedural and minor amendments to permit applications, requirements and required documentation shall become effective by amendments and updates to permit application forms approved by the director of parish administrative departments that is authorized to issue the permit.
(e)
Construction permit.
(1)
Permit required: Except as otherwise provided in this section, a construction permit shall be required by all franchisees or other entities otherwise entitled to use public rights-of-way or other property owned by, or under the control of, the parish before the commencement of construction on public rights-of-way or any other property owned by, or under the control of, the parish.
(2)
Fees: The minimum fee for a utility construction permit for the installation of utilities or similar installations on public rights-of-way or any other property owned by, or under the control of, the parish shall be one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) per each linear foot of such installations not to exceed an area of one (1) contiguous cubic foot per each linear foot of the installation ("the linear installation route") for each permit. In the event that the installation will occupy more than one (1) contiguous cubic foot per any linear foot of the linear installation route under a permit, the permit fee for such an installation shall be increased by an additional one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) for each additional contiguous cubic foot and part thereof per each such linear foot. There shall be a minimum non-refundable construction permit application fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) which shall be applied toward the final fee and a fee in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a time extension of an issued construction permit. A later utility or similar installation by the same permit holder on the same linear installation route for which a permit has been issued shall require an additional permit and fee whether such an installation is, or is not, within the contiguous cubic foot or feet per linear foot for which a permit had previously been issued.
(3)
Insurance, indemnification and completion and restoration bond: The applicant for such a permit shall provide: (a) indemnification for the parish, its districts and sub-districts for any damages to parish property of any type and third party claims related to the installation, operation or maintenance of the equipment owned by the entity, (b) insurance coverage of the same type and in the amounts and under the same conditions required in this chapter for a franchise. A completion and restoration bond in effect during the permitted work and terminating no sooner than five (5) years after the parish accepts the permitted project as complete may be required at the discretion of the parish department of engineering; such a bond shall be in an amount determined by the parish department of engineering based on the size and type of project as well as the likelihood of damage to person or property as a result of the project. The permitted project shall not be accepted as complete until the required Geographic Information Systems ("GIS") submissions related to said completed project has been accepted by the parish as complete and compatible with the parish system.
(4)
Relocations: A permit shall be required for any relocation of an existing installation on public rights-of-way and any other property owned by, or under the control of, the parish except for relocations required by a parish project for which the relocation plans have been approved by the parish. The fee shall be waived for such a permit whenever the relocation of an existing installation is requested by a local government, or state or federal agency. The owner of the equipment to be removed must provide written documentation to the appropriate parish permitting agency that the relocation is required by the parish, another local government, or state or federal agency.
(5)
Cumulative permitting option: Entities which require more than three (3) permits per month for service lines to individual residential or commercial structures have the option to use a cumulative permitting process.
a.
The cumulative permitting process shall apply only to permits for less than one hundred (100) linear foot of utility equipment installation up to a maximum of one (1) contiguous cubic foot to be occupied by utility equipment per linear foot of the linear installation route for each permit for service lines to an individual residential or commercial structure and relocations requested by a government agency. The cumulative permitting process shall not apply to any other type of installation regardless of the size or extent of the installation. For multiple individual service line installations on parish property to a multi-family or commercial structure occupied by multiple businesses, each line on parish property shall be considered a separate project under the cumulative permit.
b.
After approval by the parish of an entity's cumulative permit application, including the entity's acknowledgment that no parish personnel has the duty or may have the opportunity to inspect the project site before, during or after the installation of equipment of the utility under the cumulative permit and the fulfillment of the insurance, indemnity and restoration bond as outlined above for a permit, that entity:

May proceed with individual residential or commercial service installations after giving notice to the parish of the location of such installations but without the prior issuance of individual project permits for those installations; and
2.
Shall be allowed to furnish the length and GIS information for all such installations and also pay the permit fee on such installations on established six-month reporting and invoicing intervals.
c.
The permit fees and provisions outlined in (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(4) above shall apply to cumulative permits except that the two hundred dollar ($200.00) minimum permit fee shall apply only to the first one hundred twenty (120) permits under the cumulative permit for service line installations for which a fee is paid by the same entity within each twelve-month period. The first twelve-month period for each entity using the cumulative permitting process shall begin on the first day of the month in which the first project was permitted under the cumulative process and each following twelve-month period shall begin on the anniversary of the first period.
(6)
Exception: A permit shall not be required prior to the installation of utility or similar equipment under emergency conditions, but the owner of such equipment shall be required to notify the parish department of public works within two (2) working days of such installations on parish rights-of-way or on any other property owned by, or under the control of, the parish and the owner of such equipment shall be responsible to indemnify the parish, its districts and sub-districts for any damages which may result from such an installation or operation.
(f)
(1)
Except as otherwise provided below, the department of streets shall issue all permits for any work, excavation or activity required by this chapter.
(2)
Whenever a permit for any work, excavation, or activity is required by this chapter, it shall be a misdemeanor and a violation of this section for any person to commence or continue said work, excavation or activity without having first obtained such permit.
(3)
Whenever any person commences any such work without such a permit or continues any such work, excavation, or activity that threatens public safety, interferes with the operation or maintenance of streets, public utilities or other public works, or is in violation of this chapter or of the conditions of a permit issued under this chapter, the parish department of streets, the department of environmental affairs or the parish department of inspection and code enforcement is authorized to immediately issue and enforce an order to cease and desist from said work, excavation, or activity. Said order shall be subject to review, and all of the procedures related to said order shall be conducted in the same manner as is provided for a cease and desist order for violation of the parish building code.
(4)
In addition, any violation of this section shall be deemed a violation of a public health and environmental ordinance and shall be subject to civil administrative adjudication by the parish administrative hearing officer.
(5)
Notwithstanding the provisions of this section:

The department of environmental affairs is authorized to issue a cease and desist order and a violation citation regarding environmental permitting matters; such an order shall be subject to review, and all of the procedures related to said order shall be conducted in the same manner as is provided for a cease and desist order for violation of the parish building code. The department of environmental affairs shall provide the application forms and related documentation for such permits and shall provide notice to the streets department when such a permit is issued.
b.
Towers and antennas. The parish department of inspection and code enforcement shall issue the permits for transmission towers, radio towers, wireless telecommunications towers (including monopoles), masts, aerials and/or antennas and similar structures located on private property, including private property owned by the parish, its districts or sub-districts, excluding public rights-of-way; the parish department of streets shall issue the permits for such structures located on all public rights-of-way, regardless of ownership. All parish building code and zoning regulations as well as any other provisions of the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances regarding such structures shall apply to permits for such structures issued by either department.
(6)

Nevertheless, those provisions, including permitting procedures, inspections and fees, which most specifically address the pipeline or similar activities project at issue shall apply.
(b)
In addition to any permit fee required under Chapter 24 of this Code, the owner of a pipeline that is wholly or partially located on parish rights-of-way or other parish property, who does not have a franchise or similar grant of authority to use said property for other than generally permitted purposes, shall pay to the parish an annual minimum usage fee for each linear foot of ground surface, or space above or beneath the parallel plane of the ground surface, of such parish property occupied or otherwise used by the pipeline and related equipment (referred to as "the pipeline linear route"). This fee shall be two dollars and sixty cents ($2.60) per year per each linear foot of the pipeline linear route for up to a maximum of one (1) contiguous cubic foot per linear foot of the pipeline linear route. If any linear foot of the pipeline linear route occupies more than one (1) contiguous foot of parish property per that linear foot of the pipeline linear route, the usage fee shall be increased at the rate of an additional two dollars and sixty cents ($2.60) per year for any such linear foot for each additional contiguous cubic foot or part thereof per each linear foot of the pipeline linear route. The first such annual payment will be due upon approval of such installation and in advance on January 1st of each following year. If said fee is not paid by the thirtieth day following said due date, the owner shall in addition pay a late fee of ten (10) percent of the amount due, plus legal interest on any sum unpaid until the entire sum due is paid in full. Should the parish be required to file a civil action to collect any portion of said fee, late fees and/or interest, then the owner shall also be liable for reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.
