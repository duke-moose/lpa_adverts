The purpose of the Commercial Parkway Overlay Zone (CPZ) is to superimpose an overlay zone utilizing landscape and buffer standards to enhance the general quality of commercial and office development or structures located on arterial streets or collectors as delineated in the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan; by providing buffers to neighboring residences and other commercial uses; increase public safety by guiding traffic; by minimizing the impact of commercial development and structures on the drainage system; by decreasing the amount of paved area; and by coordinating green space and signage in commercial and office areas. Commercial Parkway Overlay Zone requirements are imposed in addition to the underlying zoning district regulations and development and structures within the overlay zone must conform to the requirements of both the district and the overlay zone, or the more restrictive of the two (2).

Area regulations concerning front, side and rear yard and lot area shall be in accordance with the underlying zoning district with the following exceptions:
(1)
In addition to front yard requirements of the underlying district, the first twenty (20) feet from the front lot line shall be the minimum front yard and building setback and shall be landscaped in accordance with section 33-6.25, Landscaping, buffering, and screening. No parking or paving shall be allowed in the required front yard except for sidewalks or approved driveways directly connecting the development site to the adjacent street. Notwithstanding provisions in Chapter 33 that establish lot frontage, for purposes of applying CPZ landscaped buffer requirements in the required yards of a corner lot and as determined by the planning director, the required front yard shall be located on the street with the higher classification in the parish thoroughfare plan, or if the streets have equal classification, it shall be located on the street upon which the building has its primary entrance.
(2)
On corner lots there shall be a yard with a minimum depth of ten (10) feet from the lot line abutting the side street, and this yard shall be landscaped in accordance with section 33-6.25, Landscaping, buffering, and screening. No building or structure shall be located within this required side yard. If a development has a side yard greater in depth than the minimum required yard, no support building or structure shall be located any closer to the lot line abutting the side street than the principal building.
(b)
All new development shall occur on sites with a minimum site area of ten thousand (10,000) square feet and a minimum frontage of seventy-five (75) feet and a minimum depth of one hundred (100) feet.
(c)
When two (2) or more adjoining lots comprise a CPZ development site, such lots shall be resubdivided into one (1) lot of record, except as provided for in section 40-472 Definitions and Permitted Uses and section 40-479(c) Group Development and Outparcels.
(d)
Development sites established prior to the effective date of this amendment, adopted on October 8, 2003, that do not meet the 10,000 square feet minimum site area requirement shall be exempt from such requirement. However, where two (2) or more adjoining and vacant lots with continuous frontage are in a single ownership at the time of passage of this amendment and such lots have a frontage or lot area less than is required by the CPZ, such lots shall be resubdivided to create one (1) development site which conforms to the minimum lot area requirements of the CPZ.

e.
Administrative examination.
1.
Upon receipt of a complete application with all information properly supplied as specified within this Code, the planning director shall forward the site plan to the Land Use Review Technical Committee (LURTC) for review and comment prior to action. Lack of findings from LURTC within ten (10) days shall be construed as no objection to approval.
2.
After evaluating LURTC comments and the site plan's compliance with applicable development regulations, the planning director shall approve the site plan or make a recommendation regarding approval of the site plan and forward it to the planning advisory board and council for action in accordance with article XLVIII, Changes and amendments, for general procedures not specified in this article by the next available advertisement deadline.
(3)
Effect of Approval.
a.
The approved site plan, as indicated by the dated signature of the council chairperson or planning director, as applicable, shall govern development and use of the property until a new or amended site plan is approved. Until a site plan is approved, no building or structure shall be erected, added to, or structurally altered; no parking lot shall be paved, added to, or structurally altered; and, no building permit or certificate of completeness shall be issued. Any deviation from the approved site plan is a violation of this Code.
b.
Final site plan approval shall be valid for a period of one (1) year.
c.
If approval of the site plan lapses because no building permit has been issued or the building permit lapses and has not been reactivated, then the approved site plan shall be deemed null and void.
(4)
Minor changes in approved CPZ site plans.
a.
Minor changes needed to facilitate construction and site improvements are permitted, if such minor changes will not change the character of the approved development or structures, nor increase the density, gross floor area, intensity of use, or ground coverage. Further no increase of total building site area, in spaces between buildings, the ratio of off-street parking and off-street loading area to gross floor area, or gross floor area shall be considered. No change shall be deemed minor to the approved CPZ site plan that alters the approved permitted uses.
b.
The director of planning shall review and determine what constitutes a minor or major change for an approved CPZ site plan and be responsible for making minor changes on the site plan, if the request is approved. Appeals of said decision by the planning director shall be forwarded to the planning advisory board for review, where a majority vote of the members shall be required to override the decision of the planning director concerning said minor change. Otherwise, an amendment to the CPZ site plan shall be required, in accordance with the procedures of this section.
(5)
Amendment of CPZ site plan. Pursuant to the same procedure and subject to the same limitations and requirements by which the CPZ site plan was approved, any CPZ site plan may be amended, either partially or completely, if all land and structures remaining under such CPZ site plan comply with all regulations established by the zoning ordinance and unrelated to the CPZ.
(6)
Phased development.
a.
Developments within an approved CPZ site plan may be developed in phases, provided that the more restrictive land uses and the necessary off-site improvements are completed first and time frame for phases is submitted at the time of the application.
b.
Approval of the CPZ site plan is voided if the development or structures is not initiated within one (1) year, and completed within two (2) years. Additional time may be granted by the Jefferson Parish Council for a period of one (1) year, upon recommendation by the planning advisory board and planning department, if completion of the approved site plan is assured.
