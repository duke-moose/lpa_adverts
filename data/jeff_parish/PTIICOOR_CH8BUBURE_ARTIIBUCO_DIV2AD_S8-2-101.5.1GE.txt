Alterations, repairs or rehabilitation work may be made to any existing building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system without requiring the entire building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system to comply with all the requirements of the technical codes provided that the alteration, repair or rehabilitation work conforms to the requirements of the technical codes for new construction.
When repair, renovation, addition, or other improvement of a building (including service systems) or structure costs equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the building or structure, before the start of repair, renovation, addition or other improvement, such building or structure shall be made to comply in its entirety with the requirements of the technical codes and this chapter for new construction. When a building is substantially damaged due to any origin, other than flooding, the building or structure shall meet the technical codes and requirements of this chapter for new construction.
This requirement does not include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or, (2) any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
Exception: Where a building or structure is substantially damaged (the cost of restoration exceeds fifty (50) percent of the pre-damaged market value of the building or structure) due to flooding, only the base flood elevation requirements for new construction shall be fully met.
