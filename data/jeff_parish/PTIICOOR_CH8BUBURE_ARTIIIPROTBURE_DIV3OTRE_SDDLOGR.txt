To establish appropriate grade or elevation for lots, structures, and facilities, the following general standards shall apply:
(1)
Floor elevation. No superstructure shall be erected until an acceptable floor elevation has been determined.
(2)
Grade elevation. No new superstructure shall have fully met the requirements of this Code unless the site has been raised to grade with approved sanitary fill. The grading is to be extended from the established curb height and shall slope upwards toward the property line, one-half (½) inch for each foot of width of sidewalk area (sidewalk area means that portion of ground between the roadway and the property line of the adjacent landowner) and then beginning at the property line shall slope upwards one (1) inch in twenty (20) feet toward the rear property line or an alternate method approved by the code official. Once an acceptable lot grade has been established, it is the owner's responsibility to maintain proper grade.
(3)
Runoff. The approved arrangements for handling direct run off (whether by retainer wall, approved sub-surface drainage, swale, or other approved alternative) shall be properly maintained by the property owner.
(4)
Sidewalk elevation. In developed subdivisions, where the existing sidewalks are not below the centerline of the street's elevation, said sidewalks shall be maintained at their present elevation.
(5)
Parking space elevation. Parking spaces shall have a minimum gradient of one-half (½) percent and a maximum gradient of five (5) percent.
(6)
Driveway or access way elevation for existing one (1)- and two (2)-family dwellings, including townhouses, elevated as part of a home elevation project. In accordance with Chapter 40, Article xxxv and Article XLII of this Code, no driveway shall be constructed with a slope greater than five (5) percent unless the BZA grants a variance.
(7)
Modifications. The parish code or engineering official, as applicable, may enforce or modify lot grade requirements to promote the public health, safety, or welfare, including, but not limited to, prevent the breeding of mosquitoes, save significant trees, preserve the ecology, or meet accessibility requirements.

In case a lot or part thereof is higher than the adjoining lot, approved arrangements shall be made to prevent water from the higher lot flowing directly onto the lower adjoining lot. If the code official determines the difference in lot elevation to be too great for a swale, a retaining wall on the rear and both side property lines shall be required. Such retaining wall shall be constructed of reinforced concrete or masonry, be a minimum of six (6) inches in thickness, and shall be constructed in such a manner as to effectively withstand the soil and water pressures exerted against it. In the case of reinforced concrete walls, the wall shall be provided with at least one (1) continuous one-half-inch diameter steel reinforcing rod for each six (6) inches of depth. The retaining wall shall extend a minimum of two (2) inches above the highest adjacent grade (including sod), and a maximum of six (6) inches above the highest adjacent grade (including sod). The retainer wall shall extend below the lowest adjacent grade to a depth equal to the height of retaining wall.
Retaining walls that meet either of the following conditions shall be designed and stamped by a design professional:
1.
Retaining walls which are more than twelve (12) inches in height above the lowest adjacent grade.
2.
Retaining walls which extend below the lower adjacent grade a depth less than its height above the lower adjacent grade.

As an alternative to the above required retainer walls, builders of new structures may elect to lower the brick ledge on slab construction or construct pier supported structures, to eliminate or minimize lot elevation differences.

In the case where the rear of the lot on which the new construction is proposed adjoins a lot on which a residence or building already exists, and which lot drains to the rear and the required elevation on the lot where the new construction is proposed is higher than the existing elevation of the lot on which the residence or building exists, then:
1.
A drainage servitude on the lot containing the new construction is dedicated and properly recorded to drain the lot on which the residence or building already exists; and
2.
Drainage facilities are properly installed on the lot containing the new construction.
No newly constructed residence or building shall be released for occupancy and no notification of release shall be sent to the utility companies until the above described drainage servitude and drainage facility requirements have been accomplished.
This section applies only in those cases where the rear lot on which a building already exists cannot raise its grade because it would cause run-off damage to the building thereon.
The above servitude requirements shall not apply to isolated singularly-developed properties.
Certificate of use and occupancy and compliance shall not be issued until a final elevation certificate has been secured.

For residential use, the top of slab shall be at or above the base flood elevation established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on its flood insurance rate map (FIRM). However, in all instances of residential use, the top of slab (floor) shall not be less than eighteen (18) inches above the crown of the street.
For non-residential use, the top of slab shall be at or above the base flood elevation established by FEMA on its FIRM or the structure, together with all attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall be designed so below the base flood level, the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components must have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
Where flood proofing is utilized to obtain compliance, a state registered civil engineer or state registered architect shall certify that the flood-proofing methods are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood. For non-residential uses, the top of slab (floor) shall not be less than six (6) inches above the crown of the street.
All construction in V zones shall also conform to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regulation and, further, a Louisiana State Registered Architect or Civil Engineer must certify that the structure is securely attached to adequately anchored pilings or columns. No manufactured homes shall be permitted in the V zones.

The lowest portion of the structural members of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings, columns, or piers) shall be at or above the base flood elevation established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on its flood insurance rate map (FIRM). A state registered civil engineer or a state registered architect must certify that the structure is securely attached to adequately anchored pilings, columns or piers. Underside of joists shall not be less than the requirements of Section R-323 Protection Against Decay (see figure R301.2(7)).
It is within the discretion of the code official to accept the provision of Section R405 Drainage, International Residential Code 2003 or Section 113 Lot Grade.

When securing a permit for a structure within the unincorporated area of Jefferson Parish, the structure shall conform to the requirements of Jefferson Parish Ordinance No. 11881, as adopted on December 12, 1974. It should not be interpreted that the Land Use Control Ordinance is a part of the Building Code nor shall the Building Code be considered part of the Land Use Control Ordinance. However, it shall be the responsibility of the code official to enforce certain sections of the Land Use Control Ordinance.
