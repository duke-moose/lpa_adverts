The use of land, buildings, and structures is regulated in accordance with the following matrices, and subject to the standards and regulations within this Code:
(a)
The Master Use Matrix (Table 33-3.4.4-1) lists all uses that are permitted or prohibited in any of the zoning districts in this UDC. A function and structure code of the Land Based Classification Standards (LBCS) of the American Planning Association (APA) corresponds to each use and shall be used to define each use (Table 33-3.4.1-1). The function code refers to the economic function or type of establishment. The structure code refers to the type of structure or building. In the zoning district use matrices, the structure code is sometimes provided to augment the function with a structural or building characteristic.
(b)
Zoning district use matrices each list all of the uses in the Master Use Matrix and identify whether each use is permitted by-right, permitted with supplemental use regulations, permitted with the approval of a conditional use permit, or prohibited. The zoning district use matrices are as follows:
(1)
Section 33-3.10, Residential Zoning Districts Use Matrix.
(2)
Section 33-3.25, Commercial Zoning Districts Use Matrix.
(3)
Section 33-3.40, Industrial Zoning Districts Use Matrix.

(a)
LBCS hierarchy.
(1)
No entry. The LBCS function codes establish a four-digit hierarchy of uses with digits to the right expressing greater specificity. Where no entry appears in the zoning district columns (for example 1000, 1100 and 1110), the uses described more specifically in the rows below (1111 and 1112 in the above example) indicate whether or not a specific use is authorized.
(2)
Entry. Where an entry appears in the zoning district columns for a general use (for example 2520) and also for a more specific use (for example 2521) within the same classification, the more specific code and its entry shall govern.
(b)
Entries for permitted uses.
(1)
A "P" indicates the listed use is allowed by right within the respective zoning district.
(2)
An "S" indicates that the listed use is allowed subject to the supplemental use regulations established in the zoning district standards, in Article 5 of this UDC, or elsewhere in the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances.
(c)
Entry for conditional uses. A "C" indicates the listed use is allowed within the respective zoning district only after review and approval of a conditional use permit by the parish council in accordance with section 33-2.24, Conditional use permit, of this UDC. For purposes of this UDC, a special permitted use is the same as a conditional use. Note that supplementary conditions for some of these uses are established in Article 5 of this UDC and within regulations for specific zoning districts.
(d)
Entry for prohibited uses. An "X" indicates the listed use is not allowed within the respective zoning district, unless otherwise expressly allowed within this UDC. When a zoning district allows mixed-use buildings as a specific development pattern, an "X" indicated for a private dwelling (LBCS function codes 1100) refers to stand-alone single use dwellings with either detached or attached dwelling units. For a mixed-use building, the number of dwelling units permitted is provided in section 33-5.20, Mixed-use buildings, of this UDC.

In the case where a use is not listed in the Master Use Matrix (Table 33-3.4.4-1), and such use is not otherwise prohibited by law, the planning director and the inspection and code enforcement director shall determine whether a substantially similar use exists in the Use Matrix. If the directors determine that a substantially similar use exists, then the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed. If the directors determine that a substantially similar use does not exist, then the planning director shall refer to the following documents and rules of construction to address the matter:
(1)
LBCS Tables, American Planning Association, LBCS Project, 07-Oct-09 or latest edition
(2)
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), United States, 2007 or latest edition.
(3)
If the planning director determines that the LBCS Tables do not address the use at the appropriate level of specificity, then she shall refer to the NAICS for guidance. If a use is listed for a general classification while a more specific classification within the same industry classification is also listed, the specific classification shall govern.
(4)
In referring to the NAICS, the planning director shall consider the industry description and illustrative examples of the most specific NAICS classification that may apply to the use, and shall compare uses across similar levels of specificity within the same NAICS classification and between NAICS and LBCS classifications.
(5)
If all nine (9) LBCS codes within a classification are populated with uses to the fourth or most specific digit, then the planning director shall determine the most appropriate location among existing codes for a use not specifically listed, based on the NAICS and LBCS descriptions and illustrative examples.
(6)
If LBCS has unpopulated codes within a classification and none of the listed codes are appropriate for the unlisted use, then the planning director shall assign a new LBCS code based on the national standardization of the NAICS and LBCS descriptions and the parish's needs for zoning and land use classification.
(7)
If the planning director determines that a new LBCS code is needed in the Master Use Matrix (Table 33-3.4.4-1), then she shall call a text study of the use matrix in accordance with section 33-2.23 to establish a specific listing for the use and the appropriate district or districts where such use shall be allowed.
(8)
If, when seeking periodic ratification of interpretations through text amendment to this Code, the planning director's or inspection and code enforcement director's interpretation is reversed by action of the council, then decisions regarding a development application made in reliance on the director's interpretation shall be valid, except that nonconforming use regulations of this Code shall apply.
