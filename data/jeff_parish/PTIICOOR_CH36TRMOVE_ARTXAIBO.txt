Airboats may be launched and operated within one (1) mile of a populated area outside of the prohibited period only if the air boat is propelled at no more than idle speed in any area within a radius of one (1) mile from the nearest inhabited dwelling. For purposes of this section, "idle speed" shall mean that speed attained by the watercraft using only the minimum amount of fuel necessary to keep the engine running.

All air boats operated within the unincorporated portion of Jefferson Parish shall be registered with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and shall at all times have the registration number issued by said department displayed on both sides of the rudder in figures of contrasting colors at least one (1) foot high and one (1) inch in width. In addition the registration numbers shall be displayed in the same color and size on the deck of decked air boats or on the bow or floor of air boats without decks in a manner so as to be visible from the air at all times.
