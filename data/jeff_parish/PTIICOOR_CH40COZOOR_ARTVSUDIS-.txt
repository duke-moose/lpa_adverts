This district is composed of certain lands and structures having a low density single-family residential character and additional open area where it is likely and desirable that such similar development will occur. Portions of these areas are not served by the full range of urban facilities such as water, sanitary sewers, natural gas and public transit. Though the district is intended primarily for residential purposes, it is recognized that agriculture and the raising of poultry and live stock is frequently desired by home owners in this district therefore provision is made for limited forms of such activity with appropriate safeguards for nearby residences.
