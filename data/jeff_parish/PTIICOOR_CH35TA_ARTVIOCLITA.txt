For the purposes of this article, unless the context clearly otherwise requires or unless otherwise defined in specific portions of the article, the following words shall have the respective meanings ascribed to each in this section:
(1)
Contractor. "Contractor" is synonymous with the term "builder" and means a person, firm, partnership, corporation, association or other organization, or a combination of them, which undertakes to or offers to undertake to, or purports to have the capacity to undertake to, or submits a bid to, or does himself or by or through others, construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve, move, wreck or demolish any building, highway, road, railroad, excavation or other structure, project, development or improvement, or to do any part thereof, including the erection of scaffolding or other structure or works in connection therewith and includes subcontractors and specialty contractors. As such, the word "contractor" shall include oil field service contractors, which shall consist of those contractors performing general oil well servicing, maintenance, and construction when conducted as a single company unit. General oil well servicing shall include welding, pipe coating, pipe inspection, wireline service, automation, workover, logging, analysis, seismograph, installing and servicing equipment, packing, platform work, perforating and completion.
(2)
Separate location. As used in section 35-159 of this article, a separate location exists unless a similar or associated type of business is operated as a unit under a single roof or on the same contiguous tract of land.
(3)
Contractor's gross receipts. For the purposes of computing the license fee provided for in section 35-175 of this article, a contractor's gross receipts are determined the same for all contractors, whether or not they have a lump sum contract or a cost-plus contract. The gross receipts for a lump sum contract are based on the actual amount of the contract, whereas the gross receipts for a cost-plus contract are based on the actual cost of the contract to the owner including the amount added thereto as a fee.
(4)
Collector. For the purpose of this article, the collector is the sheriff and ex officio tax collector for the parish, whose duty is to receive and collect the taxes and money due the parish.
(5)
Wholesale dealer. For the purpose of this article, except as specifically provided in this article, a "wholesale dealer" means any person who sells to other dealers who in turn resell.
(6)
Retail dealers to institutional consumers. For the purpose of this article, a "retail dealer to institutional consumers" includes all businesses selling, at retail from a fixed place of business, merchandise to dairymen, cattlemen, or farmers, to federal, state, parish, or municipal governments or institutions, to educational or charitable institutions, to hospitals, manufacturers, public utility companies, processors, refiners, fabricators, contractors, severers of natural resources, carriers of freight or passengers, pipelines, hotels, and restaurants provided that such sales constitute the major portion of the business.
(7)
Peddler. For the purpose of this article, a "peddler" means any person who, for himself or any other person, goes from house to house, or place to place, or store to store, exposing and selling the merchandise which he carries with him and delivering the same at the time of or immediately after the sale or without returning to the base of business operation between the taking of the order and the delivery of the goods; however, any person who uses the same vehicle or a combination of one (1) or more vehicles for the purpose of taking orders and delivering merchandise, regardless of the fact that the vehicle returns to the base of operations between the taking of the order and the delivery of the merchandise, shall be deemed a peddler, unless such person can show that the merchandise delivered is accompanied by an invoice or delivery ticket prepared at the base of operations and which conforms to the original order and that the person delivering the merchandise has permitted no deviation from the original order by allowing the purchaser to reject, cancel, increase or decrease the quantity at the time of delivery or to offset against such quantity any merchandise delivered at a prior time which is being returned. This extension of the meaning of the term "peddler" shall not be interpreted so as to prevent rejection or cancellation of bona fide orders or the return of inferior merchandise, but shall be construed so as to prevent persons peddling merchandise from escaping their tax liability by subterfuge through means of so-called "standing order" or blanket advance orders, increase and decrease in quantities at the time of delivery, arbitrary rejections and cancellations, and offset of merchandise returned by reason of nonsale rather than obligation of warranty, all of which are hereby declared to be mere devices to prevent normal methods of operations so as to disguise the business of a peddler as an ordinary wholesale business. "Peddler" shall include but is not limited to hawkers, itinerant vendors, and any retail dealers not having a fixed place of business.
(8)
Real estate broker. For carrying on each business of real estate broker, the license tax shall be based on gross income. "Gross income" for real estate brokers is defined as those fees from any source deposited into the real estate broker's agency's general fund account less escrow deposits, and less fees paid to operating real estate brokers. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the maximum amount paid by a real estate broker shall be twenty-two hundred dollars ($2,200.00).
(9)
Business. "Business" includes:
a.
Any business, trade, profession, occupation, vocation, or calling; and
b.
Any activity engaged in by any person or caused to be engaged in by a person with continuity or regularity with the object of gain, benefit, advantage, income or profit, either direct or indirect, regardless of whether the activity involves physical labor or physical work; and
c.
Any activity engaged in by any person or caused to be engaged in by a person through or by an agent, representative, manager, officer, director or employee, that qualifies as business under either of sub-parts a. or b.
(10)
Person. "Person" includes an individual, firm, corporation, partnership, association or other legal entity.
