The regulations of this article shall supplement the requirements of the zoning district, overlay, if applicable, and other standards of this Code. They are in addition to, and do not replace, other development standards unless otherwise provided. To the extent that a conflict exists between a standard in another article of the UDC or Code and a standard in this article, the standard of this article shall govern unless otherwise indicated. No conditional use or use subject to supplemental conditions may be initiated, established, or maintained unless it complies with the standards set forth for such use in this article. In some cases, these standards apply to uses allowed by right in the zoning districts subject to the supplemental standards, as indicated by an "S" in the applicable use table. In other cases, the supplemental regulations address the unique challenges of certain uses and structures or the distinct pattern of certain development whether permitted as a conditional use, as indicated by a "C" in the applicable use table, or allowed by right in the supplemental use regulations of the zoning district or overlay.

Auto-oriented development includes uses that are inherently dependent on vehicular access. These uses, properly located and designed, fulfill the public and market needs for vehicles, particularly automobiles, automobile maintenance, and services that depend on automobile access. It is the intent of these development standards to accommodate auto-oriented building forms with site layouts that provide safe and efficient vehicular circulation, minimize traffic, noise, and other nuisances, and promote design practices that blend these uses more effectively into their locations.

Amortization of short-term rentals.
1.
Findings. The parish council finds that:
i.
Generally, Jefferson Parish is characterized by a suburban development pattern of homogenous land uses concentrated in neighborhoods and along transportation corridors.
ii.
Where appropriate, mixed land uses are allowed to promote a denser, urban development pattern.
iii.
The most prevalent land use in Jefferson Parish is the detached single-family home, which comprises many quiet, well-maintained, and family-oriented neighborhoods.
iv.
The short-term rental of a home is a business that generally is not compatible with the homogenous residential character of many of Jefferson Parish's neighborhoods.
v.
Subject to use standards, the short-term rental of a home is compatible in mixed-use and commercial areas where residential and nonresidential uses co-exist.
vi.
To promote health, safety, and the general welfare, and in accordance with the comprehensive plan, the amortization of existing short-term rentals, within a reasonable timeframe, is necessary so these activities either cease operations where prohibited or come into compliance where allowed by the provisions of this Code.
2.
Purpose.The purposes of this section are to:
i.
Provide an adequate timeframe for operators of permitted short-term rentals to come into compliance with the standards and approval and licensing requirements provided for in this Code; and
ii.
Establish a fair and equitable process for the elimination of short-term rentals existing prior to the adoption date of [the ordinance from which this section derives] and prohibited by new regulations.
3.
Amortization. Any short-term rental operating prior to [date of adoption of ordinance] shall have either twelve (12) months to cease operations or six (6) months from said date to come into compliance with one of the following, as applicable:
i.
If located in a zoning district where short-term rental is prohibited, shall cease operations. During the twelve (12)-month period, the short-term rental shall be considered a nonconforming use and shall not be required to adhere to the standards set forth in section 33-5.3.9.5.G. However, upon termination of the amortization period, the short-term rental shall cease operation immediately.
ii.
If located in a zoning district where short-term rental is permitted, the short-term rental shall have six (6) months, to come into compliance with the standards set forth in section 33-5.3.9.5.G. including all required licenses.
d.
Long-term rental. Nothing in these short-term rental provisions is intended to apply to or prohibit the long term rental of a dwelling unit for thirty (30) or more consecutive days and where typically the method of rental involves an extended period of time and tenant obligations such as payment of utility bills in the name of the tenant.

This division establishes templates for certain types of development. These development patterns involve land-use and design regulations intended to promote a distinct pattern of development, and typically include multiple uses on the same property unless otherwise prohibited. The patterns are not base zoning districts or overlay zoning districts. Instead, they are forms of development that may be allowed in certain districts. The provisions of this division may describe the procedure for permitting a development pattern, and they apply to any application where the applicant chooses to develop pursuant to the standards and procedures of a development pattern.
