This district is designed to encompass residential neighborhoods on the fringes of the business core. A characteristic of this district is the prevalence of high density residential uses, which complement the adjacent business core by providing living accommodations convenient to nearby employment centers. The areas encompassed by the CD-R district may be older, developed residential neighborhoods with new, high density infill development, or less developed lands near a growing business core which contain prime locations for high density residential development. This district should have access to major thoroughfares and shall be found only in conjunction with BC-1 and BC-2, Business Core Districts.

Until a site plan is approved, no building or structure shall be erected, added to, or structurally altered; no parking lot shall be paved, added to, or structurally altered; and, no building permit or certificate of completeness shall be issued. Any deviation from the approved site plan is a violation of this Code.

No building permits shall be issued for site plans that have been declared null and void. Nevertheless, such site plans may be submitted as a new application for review, and must conform to all site plan and review requirements in effect at the time of the later application.
h.
Extensions.
1.
Standards for extension.
