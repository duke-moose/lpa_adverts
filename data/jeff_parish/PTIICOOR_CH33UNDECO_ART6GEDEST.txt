No more than one (1) principal building is permitted on a lot; except that more than one (1) institutional, public or semi-public, multiple-family, commercial, or industrial building may be located on a lot, provided that the building or portion thereof shall not be located outside the buildable area of the lot. Except for fences, no building or structure shall be built across lot lines.
(b)
Lot area. Lots shall comply with the minimum dimensions established in this Code. Where no minimum dimensions are established, all lots or development sites shall have a minimum width at the front line of fifty (50) feet and shall not be less than five thousand (5,000) square feet in area.
(c)
Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to topography and to the character of surrounding development.
(d)
Lot frontage. All lots shall front on a public street or private street improved to standards established in the Jefferson Parish Subdivision Public Improvements Standards Manual.
(e)
Variation in front yard. Where the average depth of existing front yards on lots improved with buildings located within one hundred (100) feet of either side of such lot, and within the same block and zoning district, and fronting on the same street as such lot, is less than the minimum required front yard, the front yard may be the average of the existing front yards.
(f)
Lot lines. All lots, so far as practical, shall have side lot lines at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Unusual or odd-shaped lots having boundary lines that intersect at extreme angles shall be avoided.
(g)
Lot orientation:
(1)
Generally. For interior lots, the lot line common to the street right-of-way line shall be the front line. All lots shall be arranged so that the rear line does not abut the side of an adjacent lot.
(2)
Corner lots. The lot frontage having the shortest distance shall be the front line for setback purposes, and shall bear the official municipal address in accordance with provisions for survey and street address in Chapter 8 of this Code.
(3)
Through lots. Both lot frontages shall be front lines for setback purposes. The Department of Inspection and Code Enforcement shall determine which frontage must bear the official municipal address, and the address shall be posted on the building elevation that corresponds to the frontage that is assigned the official address, in accordance with provisions for survey and street address in Chapter 8 of this Code.
(h)
Lot remnants. No lot or parcel shall be created that fails to meet the minimum standards of the applicable zoning district and this UDC, except pursuant to a PUD or Planned Development that provides for the perpetual maintenance of such remnants.

Buildings shall be compatible with the environment and exhibit the ability to provide protection from rain, sun, and high humidity.
In the picture to the left, a cantilevered roof is extended to protect the glass curtainwall from sun and weather, and the entrance is highlighted and protected from weather by a cantilevered portico. In the picture to the right, recessed ground floor entryways provide shelter from sun and weather, and a thickened façade allows for balconies but also protects glass walls from exposure.
(b)
Buildings shall maintain traditional architectural proportions. This may include, for example, smaller columns placed closer together for more vertical applications or the supports/columns having additional mass for horizontal applications. For clean, contemporary architecture, buildings must respond to human-scaled elements and elements specific to their context and our local environment.
In the picture to the left, the building utilizes contemporary design but does not give prominence to its first floor and therefore appears top-heavy, and it does not highlight entryways nor provide protection from the elements. In the picture to the right, the building's windows are not scaled properly to its overall size and window sizes are not suited to the building's commercial use.
(c)
Unless otherwise prohibited, pre-engineered industrial-style buildings devoid of scaling elements are allowed as long as they conform to all other standards and regulations.
The picture to the left is an example of a pre-engineered industrial-style building devoid of scaling elements. The picture to the right is an example of the same style of building but with scaling elements.
(d)
Multiple structures or buildings located on one property shall employ a consistent design vocabulary and use a unifying element such as material, color, or form.
In the picture to the left the multi-tenant building uses multiple architectural styles that do not employ a consistent design vocabulary. In the picture to the right, several buildings on the same lot use consistent design elements including materials and architectural details.

(a)
Purpose. These requirements are intended to promote the overall character of the parish and the specific character of a corridor, district, or neighborhood. As Jefferson Parish strategically guides development and redevelopment, it recognizes that traditional and suburban patterns reflect the established or desired character of its built environment, and that these patterns have distinct characteristics that affect greenspace. To promote site-appropriate landscaping and the proper location, selection, installation, and maintenance of plant materials, the standards of this division are organized by development character where appropriate.
(b)
Interpretation. Table 33-6.25.4-1, Base and Overlay Zoning Districts Requiring Greenspace Areas, distinguishes the base and overlay zoning districts that require landscaping by two (2) development patterns: Traditional or suburban character.
(1)
A "T" indicates traditional character: Mixed uses, narrow streets, and shallow setbacks that promote pedestrian activity, street-level shopping, and on-street, structured, or rear- or side-facing parking that is behind the front building line. Where a district is marked as "T," traditional standards apply.
(2)
An "S" indicates suburban character: Homogeneous uses, wide streets, and deep setbacks that emphasize vehicular activity, shopping malls and strip centers, and off-street, surface, or front-facing parking that is street-side of the front building line. Where a district is marked as "S," suburban standards apply.
(3)
A "T/S" indicates mixed traditional and suburban character. Where a district is marked as "T/S," either traditional character is required or suburban character is allowed, depending on the development type.
(4)
Where uncertainty exists regarding the established or desired character, the planning director shall determine the appropriate standard based on the development type or pattern, existing or future land use, or other site or neighborhood conditions.
(5)
Nothing in this division prevents the use of traditional standards where a district does not require traditional character. Traditional and suburban are relative terms. A corridor, district, or neighborhood may exhibit elements of both characters.

Generally.
(1)
Greenspace areas include streetscape, property buffers, parking lots, screening, and signs, as shown in Figure 33-6.25.5-1, Landscape Areas. Greenspace also encompasses significant trees preserved as a component of green areas or the tree canopy of a corridor or neighborhood, in accordance with section 33-6.27, Tree preservation, of this division.
(2)
The amounts of plant materials required by this section are minimum amounts. More than the minimum amount of any plant material may be approved, as long as overcrowding at maturity will not occur and jeopardize the health and longevity of required landscaping.
Figure 33-6.25.5-1. Landscape Areas
(b)
Streetscape. Streetscape landscaping is located along street rights-of-way and intended to enhance the streetscape, define entrances and walkways, provide visual breaks along blank building facades, and screen mechanical equipment and similar appurtenances.
(1)
Plant materials. Each streetscape landscape area shall be planted with trees, shrubs, and grass or other groundcover in accordance with the following requirements:
a.
Trees.
1.
Traditional (T) character: One (1) Class A tree per every thirty (30) linear feet, or fraction thereof, of street frontage is required, except that the parish landscape architect may approve multiple Class B or Class C trees as substitute if the depth of the streetscape landscape area will not accommodate one (1) or more Class A trees.
2.
Suburban (S) character: One (1) Class A tree per every fifty (50) linear feet, or fraction thereof, of street frontage is required.
b.
Shrubs. One (1) shrub per every three (3) linear feet of street frontage is required, except that perennials may substitute for no more than fifty (50) percent of the required shrubs.
(2)
Planting area. The width or depth of the area planted with streetscape landscaping shall be in accordance with the dimensional, setback, or area standards established in the applicable base or overlay zoning district.
(3)
Retaining walls. Where a retaining wall is required in accordance with section 8-3-111, Lot grade rules and regulations, of this Code, or where a retaining wall is provided, a hedge is required along the base of the wall on any street-facing side. Where a hedge is not practical due to site constraints, the street-facing surface of the retaining wall shall be finished with stucco, masonry, stone, or similar decorative material that enhances the plain concrete or plain concrete block.
(4)
Use of right-of-way. Streetscape landscaping may be located in the public right-of-way if approved by the public works director. Use of public right-of-way to meet required streetscape landscaping shall be in accordance with applicable district standards and section 29-6, Right-of-way obstruction, of this Code, and may require a parish lease of right-of-way. State-owned rights-of-way may not be used to meet the streetscape landscaping requirements of this section.
(c)
Property Buffer. Property buffers are continuous strips of landscape area located along side or rear lot lines and intended to provide separation and screening of adjacent land uses where appropriate.
(1)
Applicability and types. There are four (4) types of property buffers based on district character, use, and adjacent uses or districts. Table 33-6.25.5-2, Property Buffer Requirements by Use, establishes property buffers required for each use or zoning district, by character if applicable. The "adjacent use or zoning district" is not required to provide the buffer. Where the adjacent lot or development site contains a mixed use or is mapped with more than one (1) zoning district, the buffer requirement associated with the most intense adjacent use or district shall apply.
(2)
Table 33-6.25.5-3, Property Requirements by Type establishes the minimum depth, number of trees and shrubs, and fencing required for each type of buffer.
(3)
Prohibited uses. No active recreation area, storage of materials, impervious surface, vehicular use area including parking areas, or structures, except for necessary utility boxes and equipment, shall be located within the buffer area. The property buffer may be included in the required building setback.
(4)
Fences. Fences required as part of a property buffer shall comply with the requirements of section 33-6.12, Fences and walls, in Division 2, Design standards, of this article. No fence or wall is required if an existing fence or wall provided on an abutting property meets the requirements, as determined by the planning director.

Figure 33-6.25.5-2. Parking Lot Landscape Areas
(1)
Perimeter. The following landscaping is required in continuous areas along the perimeter of parking lots and other vehicular use areas:
a.
Street rights-of-way. In accordance with the streetscape requirements of this section, shrubs that form a living fence at maturity shall be planted along the street-facing perimeter of a parking lot or drive aisle to screen vehicles from view of the street right-of-way.
b.
Vehicular use areas. Where vehicular use areas on different development sites abut, a minimum five-foot continuous buffer with one (1) Class A tree per every thirty-five (35) linear feet, or portion thereof, plus a living fence, grass, or other groundcover, shall be provided between the abutting vehicular use areas.
(2)
Interior.
a.
For traditional (T) character, parking lots are generally situated away from street rights-of-way and complement walkability. To facilitate traditional site design, the planning director may not require some or all of the interior lot landscape areas, depending on the size and functionality of the parking lot.
b.
No interior landscape areas are required for parking lots consisting of less than ten (10) parking spaces.
c.

(6)
Each tree shall have a minimum planting area of one hundred (100) square feet and shall be planted at least thirty (30) inches from the edge of any paved surface.
(7)
Where a living fence or hedge row is planted in a setback that is between five (5) feet and seven (7) feet, each parking space abutting the hedge row shall include a wheel stop. The center of each shrub shall be planted at least three (3) feet from the curb or edge of pavement.
(8)
The groundcover required in each landscape area shall form a solid mat or cover the ground within two (2) years of installation. Where grass is provided as groundcover, sod is required.
(9)
Mulch, a minimum depth of three (3) inches, shall be provided within the root zone of trees and shrubs at the time of planting. Mulch must be kept from direct contact with tree trunks and shrub stems. The use of cypress mulch and impervious weed barriers is prohibited.
(b)
Class.
(1)
Class B and Class C trees may be used only to meet landscaping requirements where the planning director determines that special site conditions do not support planting of Class A trees.
(2)
Where the applicant has the option of Class A, Class B, or Class C trees to meet a requirement, a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the site's required trees shall be Class A trees.
(3)
Where Class B or Class C trees are used in place of Class A trees or existing trees are used to meet the requirements of this section in accordance with subsection (e), Credit, below, the ratios in Table 33-6.25.6-1, Tree Ratio by Class, shall apply.
Table 33-6.25.6-1. Tree Ratio by Class

  (c)
Species.
(1)
The List of Approved Plant Materials (list) is established and defines the species of trees and shrubs that are allowed to satisfy the landscape and buffer requirements of this section.
(2)
As reflected in the list, all required landscaping shall be comprised of plant materials that are indigenous or acclimated to the growing conditions and climate of South Louisiana.
(3)
New horticultural varieties, cultivars, and species are introduced continuously into the nursery industry, and trees not included in the list may exist in a neighborhood and provide significant tree canopy as well as contribute to neighborhood character. Jefferson Parish encourages consideration of alternate cultivars and species to promote diversity in its urban forest, match existing tree canopy, or maintain neighborhood character. For these purposes, the planning director may make exceptions to the list.
(4)
Any plant material that is listed as prohibited on the list and is proposed to remain or be planted on the site shall not count toward meeting the landscaping requirement. Artificial plant materials and invasive exotic species shall not be used to satisfy the requirements of this section.
(d)
Diversity. Design objectives should be balanced with the need for biological and species diversity. Disease and pest problems that potentially devastate a species make the planting of monocultures undesirable. The following species diversity requirements shall apply based on the number of trees required for the site:
(1)
Development with less than six (6) required trees: No diversity requirement;
(2)
Development with between six (6) and forty (40) required trees: No single species shall comprise more than thirty-five (35) percent of the total number of trees required;
(3)
Development with more than forty (40) required trees: No single species shall comprise more than twenty (20) percent of the total number of trees required.
(e)
Credit. In order to encourage the preservation of existing healthy trees, the applicant may receive credit for an existing healthy tree that is preserved and protected, in accordance with the ratios utilized to calculate credit in Table 33-6.25.6-1.

(3)
Trees preserved in each landscape area shall be credited towards the tree planting requirements of the corresponding landscape area.
(4)
As determined by the planning director, existing or natural vegetation may be used to meet the requirements for a landscape planting area if it provides equivalent planting units, or in the case of a buffer, provides complete screening from the abutting property.
(f)
Size and spacing.
(1)
When they are installed, required plant materials shall comply with the minimum size requirements of Table 33-6.25.6-3, Minimum Size and Spacing at Time of Installation.

(a)
Purpose. Jefferson Parish promotes the general welfare through sustainable, low impact development which reduces the long-term capital and operational costs of public facilities and minimizes adverse effects on the environment, public works infrastructure, and public health. Managing stormwater with low impact development (LID) techniques provides an approach to development and redevelopment that works with nature and can achieve the following benefits and purposes:
(1)
Reduce flooding, runoff, subsidence, stormwater runoff volume, peak discharge rates, sewer overflows, and the costs of stormwater and sewer treatment;
(2)
Mimic a site's predevelopment hydrology by infiltrating, filtering, storing, evaporating, and detaining stormwater runoff;
(3)
Add green space by preserving and re-creating natural landscape features including existing tree vegetation;
(4)
Use plants and soil to absorb, slow, filter, and cleanse runoff near the source;
(5)
Promote low maintenance landscaping that reduces the use of herbicides, fertilizers, and pesticides;
(6)
Minimize imperviousness to create functional and appealing site drainage;
(7)
Treat stormwater as a resource rather than a waste product and help meet National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements;
(8)
Reduce the heat island effect and mitigate the effects of development and the built environment;
(9)
Protect natural drainage features and emulate the functions of natural systems to increase recharge and reintegrate rainfall into the water cycle and watershed; and
(10)
Reduce energy and water use.
(b)
Applicability. The applicant for any site plan review required in Chapter 33 or Chapter 40 of this Code may use LID best management practices (BMPs) to meet or exceed the requirements for stormwater management in Article 7 of this UDC and for landscaping, buffering, screening, and tree preservation requirements of this Code.
(c)
Best management practices (BMPs). An application for low impact development shall demonstrate the use of BMPs, including, but not limited to, the techniques described in "Bayou Land RC&D Stormwater BMP Guidance Tool," to meet stormwater management requirements. Jefferson Parish recognizes that in most cases, BMPs, or nonstructural practices, will need to be combined with engineered or structural approaches to meet requirements. BMPs may be placed in the public right-of-way upon approval of the parish engineering director, provided that the perpetual maintenance of the BMPs is borne exclusively by the property owner.
(d)
Standards. An application for low impact development shall, in addition to all other applicable requirements, achieve the following standards, as applicable: for new developments, retain and filter the first one and one-quarter (1.25) inch rainfall event through the utilization of BMPs; or, for redevelopment, either filter the first one and one-quarter (1.25) inch rainfall event through the utilization of BMPs, reduce existing imperviousness by fifty (50) percent, or a combination of the two. These minimum standards should be achieved through the following approaches:
(1)
Utilize BMPs appropriate to the scale and type of development and specific location, and design them for effective and efficient long-term maintenance;
(2)
Consider the variation of conditions from one location to another, adjusting to the predevelopment green-to-grey continuum, existing engineered elements, character of the soil, topography, or site geometry, intensity of development, and other factors;
(3)
Minimize the need for grading and use creative grading techniques to manage stormwater runoff and encourage more filtration;
(4)
Reduce the amount of impervious surface and disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff from rooftops, sidewalks, driveways, or parking lots to landscaped areas or porous pavement;
(5)
Scrutinize setbacks, parking spaces, travel aisles, driveways, and sidewalks or walkways to see if any of these elements can be reduced in scale;
(6)
Choose native plants that are easy to maintain, adapted to the local climate and soil conditions, and possess the ability to intercept and hold rainwater and decrease water flow velocity; and
(7)
Maximize natural lands or existing vegetation set aside for conservation or preservation and protect them from clearing, grading, and other construction-related impacts.
(e)
Ministerial exceptions. Jefferson Parish encourages property owners and developers to apply low impact development techniques based on good land use planning and environmentally sound land use strategies. The parish finds that flexibility in site design practices can promote low impact development while maintaining the safety, health, and welfare of the public. To achieve the purposes of this section, for any application for low impact development that demonstrates full compliance with the standards set forth above, the planning director may approve any or all of the following ministerial exceptions:
(1)
Dimensional requirements.
a.
Decrease in minimum setback or increase in maximum setback, but no greater than fifty (50) percent of the required minimum or maximum setback, as long as:
1.
The total required landscaped and buffer area for a site is not reduced;
2.
The required buffer between a commercial district and a residential district is not reduced; and
3.
The amount of the decrease or increase is the minimum amount needed to enhance or extend BMP on the site or in public right-of-way adjacent to or in the same block as the property; and
b.
Increase or decrease in the maximum gross floor area of a building by up to twenty-five (25) percent where a zoning district provides a maximum or minimum gross floor area.
(2)
Parking requirements.
a.
Reduce the total parking requirement by up to twenty-five (25) percent, as an approximation of the floor area occupied by circulation and mechanical systems;
b.
Allow off-site parking to meet up to one hundred (100) percent of the required off-street parking, as long as the off-site site has parking in excess of its required parking and the amount of required parking spaces being reduced on-site is equal to the amount of excess spaces being provided off-site. The off-site site must be located within six hundred (600) feet measured along and following a reasonable and safe walking route from the nearest main entrance of the building or use to the off-site parking area; may be on land separated by a public right-of-way, except roads classified on the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan as interstates, freeways, or major arterials; and, shall be on land with a zoning district listed in section 40-661(3) for non-residential uses in non-residential districts. All other requirements for a recorded parking agreement shall apply; and
c.
Allow shared parking between two (2) or more non-residential uses in the development, or between non-residential uses in the development and off-site non-residential uses, whose peak parking demands occur at different times. The applicant shall demonstrate, through peak use analysis approved by the parish traffic engineer, that the number of parking spaces provided will satisfy the minimum off-street parking requirement for all uses. An applicant may use the latest peak demand analysis published by the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) or other source acceptable to the parish traffic engineer. The off-site site must comply with the provisions for an off-site site listed in subsection b above. All other requirements for a recorded parking agreement of section 33-3.56.4(c), Shared parking, shall apply.

b.
Waive the requirements for interior parking lot landscaping that specify location and minimum widths of islands, peninsulas, endcaps, and planting strips, provided that the minimum square footage of landscaped area and quantity of landscape materials required is still provided on the site, if the alternative interior parking lot landscaping layout is necessary for the proper functioning of the site's overall stormwater management system;
c.
Waive the requirement that sod be installed in all areas that are not plantings beds, provided that an alternative is proposed that positively contributes to the site's overall stormwater management system;
d.
Waive the requirement for species diversity, if the applicant can demonstrate that meeting the diversity requirement would be impracticable given the necessary design standards and constraints of the proposed stormwater management system;
e.
Waive the requirement for mulch, provided that an alternative is proposed that positively contributes to the site's overall stormwater management system; and
f.
Reduce or eliminate the requirement to irrigate the site, provided that the proposed BMPs provide the same function.

(a)
Purpose. Shared parking is based on the fact that certain uses operate at different times over a twenty-four-hour period with their greatest demand for parking occurring during mutually exclusive times. These uses are, therefore, able to share parking spaces during particular times and under certain conditions the total number of parking spaces otherwise required for individual uses may be reduced.
(b)
Generally. Where permitted, required parking may be satisfied, in whole or in part, with shared parking in accordance with the requirements of this section.
(c)
Permitted uses and minimum development size.
