When a booster pump is used on a water pressure booster system and the possibility exists that a positive pressure of ten (10) psi or less may occur on the suction side of the pump, there shall be installed a low pressure cutoff on the booster pump to prevent the creation of a vacuum or negative pressure on the suction side of the pump, thus cutting off water to the other outlets.
