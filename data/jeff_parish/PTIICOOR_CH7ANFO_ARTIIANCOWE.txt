Destruction of such animal is considered an emergency and such destruction shall be done without notice to the owner, keeper and/or harborer or a hearing.

This section shall not apply except in the discretion of the parish health unit to small caged pets such as mice, rats, gerbils, hamsters or guinea pigs and any other animal that may be specifically excluded by the animal shelter veterinarian or parish health unit.
(b)
Non-mammalian animals are not capable of contracting rabies or infecting other animals with the rabies virus. Therefore animals that are avian, reptilian, or amphibian will not require ten-day rabies quarantine or testing.
(c)
Certain mammals, particularly "wild" animals, including but not limited to raccoons, skunks, and bats that bite a human will require immediate euthanasia and rabies testing. These animals are considered to be more likely to carry and transmit the rabies virus than other mammals. Ferrets can be quarantined and observed for ten-day observation only with the approval of the state public health veterinarian and only if current rabies vaccination can be verified for the biting animal. Exceptions to required testing of wildlife may be made only by the state public health veterinarian for properly licensed wildlife rehabilitators and only at the specific, written request of the victim.
(d)
Livestock animals that bite a human are handled at the discretion of the animal shelter veterinarian. Such handling may include testing which results in euthanasia.

All stables shall, in addition to all other requirements of this article, comply with the requirements set forth below. Failure to meet these requirements shall be grounds for denial for a permit to operate, or revocation for any previously issued permit.
(1)
Application for permit. Permit application forms may be obtained from the animal shelter department at #1 Humane Way, P.O. Box 10640, Jefferson LA 70181-0640, or may be requested in writing or by telephone. Completed, notarized forms accompanied by the appropriate fee may be mailed to the above address.

Such temporary permit, however, shall not be valid for more than three (3) months from date of issue, and shall be revoked at the time of inspection if all permit requirements are not being met. Upon certification by an authorized representative of the animal shelter department that all pertinent requirements are being met, the director shall forthwith issue a regular permit which shall be valid until December thirty-first of the year issued.

Manure disposal shall be suited to the size and location of the stable area.
Any enclosure where animals are kept, other than an enclosed structure, shall be kept graded and drained so as to keep the area reasonably dry. Removal of treatment of fecal matter must provide prevention of insect growth, disease deterrence, and odor control.

In a dispute over the health or condition of the animal, the owner/operator shall have the right to present the opinion of his own veterinarian to the inspector before a decision is reached. If further veterinary advice is warranted, the shelter veterinarian may be consulted after the attending veterinarian has been notified. In all cases, the owner/operator has the right to petition the board for a hearing before his permit is refused or revoked.
