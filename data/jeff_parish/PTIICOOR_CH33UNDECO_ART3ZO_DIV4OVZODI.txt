The purpose of the Commercial Parkway Pedestrian (CPZ-Ped) Overlay district is to provide enhanced development standards that support the following objectives:
(1)
Encourage development that exhibits the physical design characteristics of a more traditional pedestrian-oriented streetscape;
(2)
Prevent vehicular areas from dominating the views of the neighborhood from the sidewalk and street;
(3)
Promote compatibility between uses through standards for screening, buffering, and landscaping;
(4)
Promote safe, attractive building and site design by requiring site plan review subject to development standards that provide for a more efficient, harmonious arrangement of land uses, buildings, landscaping, circulation systems, and infrastructure;
(5)
Accommodate horizontal and vertical mixed use, including buildings with retail, service, and other uses on the ground floor and residential units above;
(6)
Promote public health and general welfare by facilitating walkability and varied transportation options; and
(7)
Reduce the impacts of commercial development upon neighborhoods, enhance the air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote safety.

The Avondale Industrial Marine (AIM) District is an overlay district intended to recognize and protect the historically productive industrial site commonly known as the "Avondale Shipyard."
The AIM District promotes the redevelopment of the site as a strongly performing, value-added logistics hub that encompasses production, distribution and repair and takes advantage of the existing multi-modal transportation infrastructure that provides direct access to port, rail, and roadway systems. The Avondale site is suitable for the AIM district by having the following characteristics:
•
At least seventy-five (75) percent of the land area in the district was zoned and improved for industrial uses at least twenty-five (25) years ago. For this purpose, improved shall mean developed with buildings or other structures, paving, or storage for industrial uses;
•
It is at least two hundred (200) contiguous acres, has a minimum frontage on the Mississippi River of one (1) mile, and contains or is within three hundred (300) feet of an active rail line measured from the property line of the site.
The AIM district has the following purposes:
(1)
Protect and promote active or prime industrial land along the Mississippi River to take advantage of port and rail facilities and services that represent indispensable nodes in the global economic network;
(2)
Provide industrial businesses greater ease and more certainty in their ability to remain and prosper in their current locations;
(3)
Facilitate a wide variety of production uses and activities and promote integrated, value-added logistics hubs;
(4)
Promote strong distribution and repair infrastructure with efficient freight and warehousing networks;
(5)
Facilitate modern and state-of-the-art processes, controls, buildings, and equipment for production, distribution, and repair that minimize nuisance complaints and keep impacts on adjacent and nearby areas to a minimum;
(6)
Discourage an inappropriate level of non-industrial uses and encourage appropriate commercial activity that could improve employment opportunities and the physical condition of the district without conflicting with production, distribution, and repair activities;
(7)
Improve employment diversity, the quality of jobs, and wages in Jefferson Parish;
(8)
Promote orderly development to efficiently bring regional assets back into commerce; and
(9)
Promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents and businesses.
