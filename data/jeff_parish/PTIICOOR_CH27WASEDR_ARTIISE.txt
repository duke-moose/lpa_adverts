(a)
Tightness of lines; proof. The tightness of all newly constructed sewers and their appurtenances shall be proved by an infiltration and/or exfiltration test and color photography test with equipment designed for the purpose and of a quality equal to that system used by AAA Pipe Cleaning Corporation; all of such tests shall be conducted and certified by recognized testing laboratory employed for the purpose by the parish; such testing laboratory so employed after the completion of any such test shall report its findings to the parish council, the parish president and the necessary departments of the parish.
(b)
Infiltration test and exfiltration test. Where the ground water table is four (4) feet or more above the average invert of the sewer, or less than four (4) feet below the average round surface, an infiltration test shall be conducted. Where the ground water table is not within the above limits, an exfiltration test shall be applied.
(c)
Conduct of infiltration test. The infiltration test shall be conducted by isolating the section under test and measuring the quantity of infiltration by means of a sharp-crested weir at the outlet or by pumping through a calibrated water meter. Infiltration shall be limited to two hundred fifty (250) gallons per inch diameter per mile per day.
(d)
Conduct of exfiltration test. The exfiltration test shall be conducted by isolating the section under test, filling the sewer to an elevation not less than four (4) feet above the invert or more than four (4) feet above the average ground water table, whichever is higher, oil to the bottom of the manhole cover frame. After reasonable time of allowance for absorption in masonry and joints, water shall be added through a calibrated water meter. exfiltration shall be limited to three hundred (300) gallons per inch diameter per mile per day.

Editor's note— It should be noted that §§ 3 and 4 of Ord. No. 23008, adopted Feb. 28, 2007, provide as follows:
"SECTION 3. If the plant investment fee is being charged and the current owner of the premises was the owner of the premises on August 28, 2005, and is rebuilding or restoring the property due to damages sustained by Hurricanes Katrina or Rita, then the property owner will only be charged the difference between the meter size located at the property on August 28, 2005 and the larger meter size resulting from the restoration. If the meter size stays the same then no plant investment fee will be charged."
"SECTION 4. Jefferson Parish, through the Department of Sewerage and the Finance Department, shall refund any plant investment fee paid by any person, or firm, who already paid said fee prior to the effective date of this ordinance if the fee would have been subject to waiver had this ordinance been effective at the time the plant investment fee was assessed; said refund shall be processed automatically by the department to the payer of the fee by U.S. mail, properly addressed with postage prepaid, within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this ordinance."

(c)
Monthly service charge. A monthly service charge shall be assessed according to the meter size for each account. The base service charges are dependent on the size of the water meter and whether the customer is billed monthly or bi-monthly. The base rates are adjusted annually beginning March 1, 2000 and thereafter every January 1st based on the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. The annual adjustment to these charges will equal a U.S. City Average 12 month percentage change in the All Urban Consumers—All Items Index (CPI-U) as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

(a)
A parish utility consumer is entitled to have the water and sewer charges adjusted no more than once in a twelve-month period as outlined in the following:
(1)
Increase due to leak or act of vandal. A parish utility consumer's water and sewerage charges can be adjusted if the increase in charges is directly identified to a leak in the consumer's water system or damage caused by an act of a vandal which caused a waste of water, an increase in water consumption.
(2)
Historical average consumption.
a.
For adjustment affecting the sewerage system, the adjustment of the parish utility, consumer's water and sewerage charges be recalculated using the historical average consumption of the consumer's account plus one-half (½) of the excessive consumption. For example, the average consumption is subtracted from the consumption of the bill that is to be adjusted. The difference between the average consumption and the consumption that is being questioned will be referred to as unadjusted consumption. The unadjusted consumption is divided into two (2) equal amounts. The parish departments of water and sewerage will add one (1) part to the average consumption and refer to this figure as the adjusted consumption. The charges for sewerage and water are then recalculated using the adjusted consumption. The difference between the charges for sewage and water on the original bill and the charges generated using the adjusted consumption is to be the dollar value of the adjustment to the consumer;
b.
For adjustment not affecting the sewer system, the adjustment of the parish utility consumer's sewerage charge shall be recalculated by using the historical average consumption of the consumer's account only. The difference between the charges for sewerage on the original bill and the charges generated using the historical average consumption is to be the dollar value of the adjustment to the consumer. The adjustment for water will remain as established in subsection (a).
(3)
Repairs required. The parish departments of water and sewerage may require, prior to adjusting a consumer's bill, that the necessary repairs to their system be made. The parish departments of water and sewerage should be satisfied that a leak did exist and has been repaired. This may be accomplished by inspection which would verify a leak existed and the repairs made or a signed affidavit be executed by the consumer to this effect and/or a copy of a plumber's invoice that the leak was repaired.
(b)
Increase due to a catastrophic event. A parish utility consumer's water and sewerage charges can be adjusted if the increase in the charge is directly identified to be damage caused by a catastrophic event.
A catastrophic event occurs when the Jefferson Parish President declares a state of emergency pursuant to the Louisiana Homeland Security and Emergency Assistance and Disaster Act as defined in R.S. 29:721 et seq.
After a state of emergency is declared, the director of water must request from the Jefferson Parish Council, the authority to adjust utility bills on a case by case basis if the adjustment is directly identified to be damages caused by the catastrophic event. The director of water may restructure, reduce or waive the consumer's water consumption and sewer user fees on a case by case basis, up to and including the complete waiver of fees for a given period following a catastrophic event, if such waiver is warranted by the facts of the case as presented to the director. Persons wishing to contest any such decision of the director of water may appeal the director's decision directly to the Jefferson Parish Council. In such cases, the decision of the council regarding the adjustment of the utility bill shall be final.
