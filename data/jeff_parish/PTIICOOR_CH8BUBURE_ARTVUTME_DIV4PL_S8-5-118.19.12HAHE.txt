Any conditions, devices, or practices in the water supply system and its operation, which create, or, in the judgment of the director, may create a danger to the health and well being of the water consumer.
A health hazard is a structural defect in the water supply system, whether of location, design, or construction, which may regularly or occasionally prevent satisfactory purification of the water supply or cause it to be polluted from extraneous sources.
