Authority. The department of public works, traffic engineering division, is hereby authorized to determine and designate intersections where particular hazard exists and to determine:
(1)
Whether vehicles shall stop at one (1) or more entrances to any such intersection, in which event a stop sign will be erected at every such place where a stop is required; or
(2)
Whether vehicles shall yield right-of-way to vehicles on a different street, in which event a yield sign will be erected where obedience thereto is required.
(b)
Driver approaching stop sign:
(1)
Every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop intersection indicated by a stop sign shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, in the event there is no crosswalk, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection;

Such driver after having stopped shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle which has entered the intersection from another roadway or which is approaching so closely on the roadway as to constitute an immediate hazard.
