Building permit total valuations shall include the cost of the building or structure and all related service systems. The total value shall include associated materials and labor costs. If, in the opinion of the code official, the valuation of the building, structure, alteration, or service systems appears to be underestimated or misrepresented, the building permit shall be denied unless the applicant can show detailed estimates which meet the approval of the code official.
