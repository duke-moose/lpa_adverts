Specific requirements for site plans and plats are provided in other articles of this chapter and applicable sections of Chapter 8, Buildings and building regulations, and Chapter 33, Unified Development Code, of this code, as supplemented by application requirements of the planning department or inspections and code enforcement department, as applicable. Generally, all applications for a building permit, all applications where a zoning base or overlay district requires site plan review, or all activities where approval by the department of inspection and code enforcement is required, shall be accompanied by a current survey of the property and a plan of the building site drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the size, height, and location of the building(s), and structures to be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed or structurally altered or relocated, the size and location of any existing buildings or structures on the lot, and such other information as may be necessary to provide for the enforcement of these regulations. All required parking areas, drive aisles, and access driveways must be shown and the individual parking stalls clearly indicated. Any and all revisions made to the original or subsequent revised versions of the plan, either through the review process or as a minor amendment during construction, shall be clearly indicated on a new plan or by a cloud on the original drawing and an itemized list of changes indicated on the plan, and shall include the date of each such revision. Complete records of applications, plans, and plats shall be maintained in the office of the inspection and code enforcement director or the office of the planning director, as appropriate to the type of application.
