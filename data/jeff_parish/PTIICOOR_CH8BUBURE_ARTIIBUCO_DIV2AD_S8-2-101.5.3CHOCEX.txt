Subject to the approval of the code official, the character of the occupancy of existing buildings may be changed and a building may be occupied for purposes in other groups without conforming to all the requirements of this chapter for those groups if the code official determines the new or proposed use is less hazardous than the existing allowed use from a life safety and fire risk perspective. Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing the code official from requiring the implementation of additional safety measures or the removal of definite hazards to life in existing buildings not being required to comply fully with present requirements of this chapter for that group. Any permissive change in the character of occupancy of a building shall be contingent upon compliance with all state and parish laws and regulations.
