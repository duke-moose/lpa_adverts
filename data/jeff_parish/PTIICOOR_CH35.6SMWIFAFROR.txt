To protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the unincorporated areas of Jefferson Parish and to preserve and protect community character and aesthetic quality, the parish has determined that any grantee seeking a permit to deploy facilities in the public rights-of-way shall comply with the following design characteristics and requirements:
(a)
General design guidelines.
(1)
A Grantee shall not deploy any facility [or] part thereof that: (i) obstructs, impedes, or hinders the usual travel or public safety on a public right-of-way; (ii) interferes with entry or exit from a residence or business, use of a delivery area, or use of a bus, taxi, or valet loading zone; (iii) blocks view of traffic signs or signals; or (iv) interferes with access to a fire hydrant, fire station, fire escape, water valve, underground vault, valve housing structure, or any other public health or safety facility.
(2)
Grantees shall ensure to the extent technologically feasible that all elements of a facility: (i) are designed, located, and/or camouflaged in such a manner as to minimize their visual and sound impact, and (ii) conform with the community character and general aesthetic and design standards of the surrounding neighborhood.
(3)
Facilities shall be located such that views from a residential structure are not significantly impaired.
(4)
Grantees shall use the least visible equipment possible. To the extent technologically feasible: (i) all antenna elements shall be flush mounted to the side or top of a pole or support structure or mounted as closely to the pole or support structure as technologically possible and in no event more than twelve (12) inches from the pole or support structure, (ii) all antenna mounts shall be designed so as not to preclude possible future collocation by the same or other operators or carriers, and (iii) all antenna equipment shall be pole-mounted or located underground.
(5)
In the event that it is not technologically feasible to locate antenna equipment on a pole or underground, such antenna equipment shall be enclosed in a cabinet or other enclosure which complies with all applicable design standards provided for in this article II. In locations where homes are only along one side of a street, to the extent technologically feasible ground-mounted facilities shall not be installed directly in front of a residence and shall instead be installed along the side of the street with no homes unless an exception is granted.
(6)
Each facility shall be designed to occupy the least amount of space in the public right-of-way that is technologically feasible.
(7)
Each facility shall be properly engineered to withstand wind loads as required by all applicable codes and all applicable local, state, and federal laws. An evaluation of wind load capacity shall include the impact of modification of an existing facility.
(b)
Antenna design guidelines.
(1)
Each antenna that does not have exposed elements:
a.
Must be located inside an enclosure of not more than six (6) cubic feet in volume;
b.
May not exceed a height of six (6) feet above the existing pole or support structure;
c.
May not protrude from the outer circumference of the existing pole or support structure by more than two (2) feet; and
d.
May not cause an antenna support pole to exceed the height restrictions set forth in section 35.6-16(c).
(2)
If an antenna has exposed elements, the antenna and all of the antenna's exposed elements:
a.
Must fit within an imaginary enclosure of not more than six (6) cubic feet;
b.
May not exceed a height of six (6) feet above the existing pole or support structure;
c.
May not protrude from the outer circumference of the existing pole or support structure by more than two (2) feet; and
d.
May not cause an antenna support pole to exceed the height restrictions set forth in section 35.6-16(c).
(3)
The cumulative size of other equipment associated with the base station:
a.
May not be more than twenty-eight (28) cubic feet in volume;
b.
Protrude from the outer circumference of the existing pole or support structure by more than two (2) feet;
c.
To the extent permitted under section 35.6-16(a)(5), ground-based enclosures, separate from the pole or support structure, may not be higher than three (3) feet six (6) inches from grade, wider than three (3) feet six (6) inches, or deeper than three (3) feet six (6) inches; and
d.
Mounted enclosures may not cause an antenna support pole to exceed the height restrictions set forth in subsection 35.6-16(c).
The following types of associated ancillary equipment are not included in the calculation of equipment volume under subsection (b)(3): electric meters; concealment or camouflage elements; telecommunications demarcation boxes; grounding equipment; power transfer switches; cut-off switches; and vertical cable runs for the connection of power and other services.
(c)
Antenna support pole design guidelines.
(1)
All antenna support poles, including replacement antenna support poles, shall be constructed of composite material or other non-wooden material.
(2)
Wires, fiber, and cable running the length of any non-wooden antenna support pole shall be installed inside the pole.
(3)
All antenna support poles in the public right-of-way shall be of monopole design.
(4)
No antenna support poles shall exceed the lesser of fifty (50) feet in height above ground level or no more than ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing pole located within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed antenna support pole in the same right-of-way.
(5)
Antenna support poles must be spaced at least one hundred (100) feet apart from any other poles in the same public right-of-way unless the grantee establishes that a shorter distance is technologically necessary to support a wireless service provider's customer needs.
(6)
All antenna support poles installed in the public rights-of-way shall have collocation capabilities to the extent technologically feasible.
