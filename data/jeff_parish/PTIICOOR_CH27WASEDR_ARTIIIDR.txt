There is hereby established a system of charges for the operation of a mosquito control program by the parish. The base, suppression and surveillance charges for the operation of the mosquito control program are based on the type of structure and/or building serviced. The base, suppression and surveillance charges will be adjusted annually beginning March 1, 2000 and thereafter every January 1st based on the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. The annual adjustment will equal a U.S. City Average 12 month percentage change in the All Urban Consumers-All Items Index (CPI-U) as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The service charge shall be collected regularly on the same billings of the waterworks of the parish, payable at the offices of the department of water and its authorized collecting agencies. All accounts shall be considered delinquent if not paid within ten (10) days after receipt of same. If a delinquent account is not paid within thirty (30) days after receipt of bill, the parish shall have the right to proceed for the collection of such unpaid charges in a manner provided by law for the collection of parish claims.
(b)
The CPI mosquito control program charges are published in the Official Journal of Jefferson Parish and in the Progressive Jefferson, the publication ordinarily accompanying the water bills themselves. The collection of the mosquito control service charge shall be put into effect by adding the charges to the regular water bills in those areas served by water districts of the parish. In the municipalities not served by the parish water districts, the chairman of the council, or in his absence, the vice-chairman, is authorized to enter into a contract with the municipalities for the collection of the service charge on their regular water bills.
