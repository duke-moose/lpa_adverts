The purpose of the Old Bucktown Mixed Use Residential District (OBM-1) is to provide a primarily residential district mixed with some light commercial uses to support the needs of the neighborhood. The OBM-1 shall serve as a transition zone between the less restrictive Old Bucktown Mixed Use Commercial District (OBM-2) located to the north and the more restrictive single family residential districts located to the south and west, particularly with respect to permitted uses, height, and density. The OBM-1 employs special design standards that respect the area's relationship with Lake Pontchartrain, promote pedestrian and bicycle access and circulation, reduce vehicular movements, encourage walkability, increase public safety, and improve the overall quality of development with alternative innovative residential and mixed use design. In order to ensure the residential character of the OBM-1, design standards are geared toward maximizing architectural compatibility in the mixed use of residential and limited retail and service establishments allowed in the district and building a safe and dynamic pedestrian environment.

(a)
Building design standards.
(1)
Purpose. Design standards shall be applied in Fat City in order to recognize, preserve, and protect the culture and history of Fat City, while promoting modern design and an urban environment that looks towards the future.
(2)
Standards. Section 33-6.8, Building design, shall apply, with the following exception: Pre-engineered industrial-style buildings devoid of scaling elements, as described in section 33-6.8.3.1(c), are prohibited in the FC-1 district.
(3)
Design basis. As Fat City developed, largely in the 1960s and 1970s, much of its architecture followed the latest trends of the time. Building on Fat City's architectural character established by its historic stock of buildings, the parish desires to enhance Fat City's urban environment and economic viability by creating a consistent visual character, promoting quality design practices and materials, and encouraging a clean, contemporary architectural style through the application of the following guidelines:
a.
Commercial architecture.
• Building entrance is highlighted using an extended frame.
• Storefronts are broken up using varied building height along the length of the façade.
• Large storefront windows allow for ample transparency, and are in proportion with the building's first floor height.
• Prominent yet subtle signage is employed to announce both the complex and the individual vendors.
• Several simple materials are used to create the design, including brick, concrete, and metal panels.
b.
Residential architecture.
• Building entrances are highlighted using stairs that project from the façade.
• The building remains the same height across its façade, but individual units are distinguished by changing planes and with the use of protruding clearstory canopies.
• Transparency is given priority, though additional shade and screening devices would likely be utilized in our hot southern climate.
• Both trees and low plantings help to provide a human scale to the streetscape, breaking up the long façade.
• Simple, clean details are created using a palette of basic materials: masonry, glass, metal panels, and concrete.
c.
Civic architecture.
• An open corner creates a welcoming presence, while the entrance is provided with shade and weather protection.
• The building remains the same height across its façade, but clearstory windows provide a separation from the façade, which creates visual interest.
• Trees are provided, though additional landscaping would allow the building to better relate to the scale of pedestrians.
• Simple, clean details are created using a palette of basic materials: masonry, glass, metal panels, and concrete.
(b)
Entrances. Non-residential or mixed-use buildings must have a customer entrance door facing each abutting street. For buildings facing two (2) streets, a corner entrance door is allowed.
(c)
Garage doors for outdoor seating. A use with outdoor seating may utilize a garage door in relation to the outdoor seating if a minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of the garage door is transparent.
(d)
Mural. Murals are allowed on building walls and masonry fences or enclosures. A mural:
(1)
Shall not:
a.
Extend more than six (6) inches from the surface on which it is applied;
b.
Extend beyond the height of the structure on which it is applied;
c.
Obscure required openings; and
d.
Include moving or protruding elements.
(2)
May feature the name of the artist(s) of the mural and date of completion in the form of a plaque or notation not to exceed the lesser of five (5) percent of the mural area or six (6) square feet. The plaque or notation bearing the name of the artist(s) must be located in a lower corner of the mural area.
(3)
Must be applied in a durable material or paint finish that can withstand at least five (5) years of regular wear and weathering.
(4)
May be externally illuminated, but may not include internally illuminated elements.

(a)
Purpose. The parish finds that adequate parking is important for the economic success of Fat City. Many properties in Fat City will be unable to accommodate required parking due to their smaller lot size. Dispersing parking off-site in a way that serves multiple properties provides a more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable way to serve Fat City's parking needs. The parish finds that, at the time of new development, redevelopment, or change of use requiring site plan approval, a proportionate capital contribution to construct additional public parking is a fair and equitable method of apportioning the cost of such additional parking among all property within the Fat City districts without unreasonably burdening vacant lands or existing development that is not undergoing new development, redevelopment, or change of use. Accordingly, this section allows property owners to substitute payments toward off-site parking for required on-site parking.
(b)
Maximum mitigation. The amount of required parking that may be mitigated through this section shall not exceed:
(1)
Seventy (70) percent for retail, restaurant, or office uses;
(2)
Ten (10) percent for lodging uses; or
(3)
Fifty (50) percent for all other uses.
(c)
Amount. Pro rata contributions shall be based on the capital costs of providing parking spaces in parking structures. The per-stall fee shall be eighteen thousand four hundred dollars ($18,400.00) in 2010 dollars and shall be adjusted annually in November of each year based on the "Engineering News Record" Construction Cost Index 20-City average (ENR CCI) for November. The actual fee-in-lieu amount shall be established at the time of payment and approved by the parish attorney.
(d)
Payment. No certificate of completion shall be issued until complete payment has been received by the parish or the parish council has:
(1)
Approved an agreement providing for a phased payment plan. In no case shall payments be deferred for more than two (2) years;
(2)
Approved an agreement providing for the deferred construction or occupancy of floor space for which parking has not been mitigated; or
(3)
Approved other arrangements providing for required parking to serve the proposed use within twelve (12) months of the application. In no case shall arrangements include a parking variance.
(e)
Parking mitigation fund.
(1)
All proposed parking mitigation contributions shall be approved by the parish attorney, and the parish shall deposit and hold all contributions, together with interest thereon, in a parking mitigation fund hereby created, and said funds shall be expended only for the purpose of creating new public parking serving the Fat City districts.
(2)
The cost of creating new public parking shall include all costs related to land acquisition, design, permitting, drainage, mitigation, and construction of lighted and paved public parking, including engineering, legal, consulting, and internal overhead costs.
(3)
The moneys in the parking fund may be allowed to accumulate from year to year until the parish council determines to expend the moneys in the fund for the purposes specified.
(4)
The moneys shall be expended in all cases within five (5) years of collection. Any contribution not expended shall be refunded to the property owner of record at the time of the refund.
(f)
Credits. The imposition or payment of any such payments does not bar the subsequent imposition of any special assessment upon the new development, redevelopment, or change of use of any premises for which such fees have been previously imposed or paid. However, any special assessment for similar or like purposes takes into consideration such prior imposition and payment and provides the then current owner of the premises with an equitable credit for the fee actually paid for such similar or like purposes.
