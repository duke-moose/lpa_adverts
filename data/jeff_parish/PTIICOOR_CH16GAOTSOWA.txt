The enclosures for said bulk waste containers shall include a drain and the drain shall be covered so that storm water does not enter the drain. The drain shall connect into the interceptor which shall be tied into the sanitary sewer system. If the director of inspection and code enforcement determines that tying into the drain is unfeasible due to location of the bulk waste container, then the director of code enforcement may require the installation of an interceptor with a minimum capacity of forty (40) pounds for the container.

(i)
Appeal. If the applicant wishes to appeal the decision of the director, that appeal must be made to the bureau of administrative adjudication as set forth in section 2-5-4 of the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances.

(a)
Charges for collection of solid waste and recyclable materials.
(1)
There is hereby established a system of combined charges for the operation of a parish wide solid waste and recyclable materials collection program for solid waste and recyclable materials placed between the sidewalk and the curb. The base charge for the operation of the solid waste and recyclable materials collection program will be adjusted annually beginning January 1, 2015 based on the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. The annual adjustment will equal a U.S. City Average twelve (12) month percentage change in the All Urban Consumers—All Items Index (CPI-U) as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The service charge shall be collected regularly on the same billings of the waterworks of the parish, payable at the offices of the department of water and its authorized collecting agencies. All accounts shall be considered delinquent if not paid within ten (10) days after receipt of same. If a delinquent account is not paid within thirty (30) days after receipt of bill, the parish shall have the right to proceed for the collection of such unpaid charges in a manner provided by law for the collection of parish claims.
The CPI adjusted solid waste and recyclable materials collection charges are published annually in the Official Journal of Jefferson Parish and in the Progressive Jefferson, the publication ordinarily accompanying the water bills themselves.
(2)
The above-mentioned service charge will be collected bimonthly on the same billing of the waterworks of the parish, payable at the offices of the department of water and its authorized collecting agencies.
(3)
All accounts shall be considered delinquent if not paid ten (10) days after receipt of same. If a delinquent account is not paid within thirty (30) days after receipt of the bill, the director of environmental affairs shall cease all solid waste and recyclable materials collection for that account. Service shall be resumed thereafter only on payment of the accumulated fees for the period of collection plus ten (10) percent.
(4)
The stoppage of services hereinbefore authorized for nonpayment of collection charges shall be in addition to the right of the parish to proceed for the collection of such unpaid charges in a manner provided by law for the collection of a parish claim.
