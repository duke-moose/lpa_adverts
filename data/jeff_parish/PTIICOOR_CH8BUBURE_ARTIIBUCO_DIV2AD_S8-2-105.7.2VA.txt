COMPARE VERSIONS
The owner of a building, structure or service system, or his duly authorized agent, may appeal a decision of the code official to the board and apply for consideration of a variance whenever any one (1) or the following conditions are claimed to exist:
1.
The code official rejected or refused to approve the mode or manner of construction proposed to be followed or materials to be used in the installation or alteration of a building, structure or service system.
2.
The provisions of this chapter do not apply to this specific case.
3.
That an equally good or more desirable form of installation can be employed in any specific case.
The board of standards and appeals, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of the chapter to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement therefore would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this chapter or public interest, and also finds all of the following:
1.
That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service system involved and which are not applicable to others.
2.
That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant.
3.
That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other buildings, structures or service system.
4.
That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system.
5.
That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this chapter and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare.
