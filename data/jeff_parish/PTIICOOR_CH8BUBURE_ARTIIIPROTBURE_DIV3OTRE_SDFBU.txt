Where bulkhead location requires U.S. Corps of Engineers approval, said bulkhead design and construction shall meet current industry standards, be designed and certified by a licensed civil engineer who shall also specify the anticipated length of life of such bulkhead.
Where the foundation of a principal use structure is designed within two (2) feet of a certified bulkhead, the design professional shall consider the effects of the bulkhead's construction and maintenance on the integrity of the proposed foundation. The design engineer shall then verify that he has considered the effects of the certified bulkhead construction and maintenance on the proposed foundation and specifically state on the foundation plan that such due consideration has been given.
