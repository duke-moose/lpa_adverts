Any defects noted at time of scheduled inspection of work shall be corrected within forty-eight (48) hours. Failure on the part of the licensed plumbing contractor to comply shall forfeit his right to file on any other work until corrections are made. To protect the license holder's rights to file on other work a re-inspection shall be requested after corrections are completed.
Every licensed plumbing contractor in accordance with these regulations shall be responsible for any defects of construction, installation, and repairs of any plumbing systems, until a certificate of approval has been issued by the code official.
Also, any defects that may have been concealed by the licensed plumbing contractor and discovered by the code official or his designee after a certificate of approval has been issued shall be the responsibility of, and corrected by said licensed person.
