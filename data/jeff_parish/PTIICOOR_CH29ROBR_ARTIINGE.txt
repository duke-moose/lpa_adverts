Interstates are federal routes that are state-maintained and are part of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways.
(2)
Major arterial shall mean a street primarily designed to move traffic between cities or parishes. These streets have traffic signals at intersection with other arterials, collectors, driveways, or local streets, and may be designated for limited access. These streets may be higher speed, provide access to the interstate highway network within cities, may run through downtown areas, and may contain service roads. On-street parking, and loading and unloading of vehicles are generally discouraged along these streets. Identified as a major arterial upon the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan.
(3)
Minor arterial shall mean a street primarily designed to move traffic from neighborhoods through an area.

Collector street shall mean a street which moves traffic between neighborhoods or from the core of the neighborhood to its edge. In a typical suburban area, these streets may carry some through traffic if located adjacent to a community facility (school, park, library, community center, fire station).

Identified as a collector street upon the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan.
(5)
Neighborhood collector shall mean a street which provides access to residences, public facilities such as schools, recreational centers, fire and police stations, and parks located within neighborhoods. Identified as a neighborhood collector upon the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan.
(6)
Local street shall mean a street constructed to established standards, as specified in the subdivision regulations of this code, and intended primarily to provide direct property access and serving local, as distinct from through, traffic, with on-street parking generally permitted. Identified as a local street upon the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan.
