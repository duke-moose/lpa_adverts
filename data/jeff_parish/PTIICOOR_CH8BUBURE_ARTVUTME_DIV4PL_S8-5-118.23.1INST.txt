Liquid waste containing fats, oils, grease, sand, or other contaminants that can be removed through gravity separation shall be required to pass through an interceptor prior to discharge into the parish sewerage system to protect the building sewer system and/or the sanitary sewerage system, except when, in the opinion of the chief plumbing inspector or his designee, such a device is not necessary.
Prior to installation, the size and type of each interceptor shall be approved by the chief plumbing inspector or his designee, in accordance with generally accepted standards set forth in this Code. No wastes other than those requiring treatment or separation shall be discharged into any interceptor. No interceptor shall be used until its installation has been approved by the chief plumbing inspector or his designee.
