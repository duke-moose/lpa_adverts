Editor's note— The Charter printed herein was adopted on November 5, 1957 and became effective November 8, 1957. Words added for clarity are indicated by brackets. Subsequently, Ord. No. 19100, adopted June 8, 1994, amended the Charter in its entirety to read as herein set out.
Annotation—Section 3(c), Art. XIV, La. Const., creating charter commission, declared constitutional over the objection that bill adopted by senate was not the same bill passed by house. Court held the senate entries in journal afford the conclusion that it was the same bill, although clerical error made in setting out bill as it was before amendment by house. Lucas v. Burkett, et al., 233 La. 896; 98 So. 2d 229.

(A)
The Parish Council shall be the legislative and policy making body of the parish and shall have authority, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter, by the Constitution of this State, and specifically by Article XIV, Section 3(c) of the Constitution of 1921 and Article VI, of the Constitution of 1974, pertaining to the powers of the Sheriff, the Tax Assessor, the Clerk of the District Court, the School Board, and the incorporated municipalities of the parish, to exercise all powers of the parish, and to adopt such ordinances and resolutions as may be proper in the exercise thereof. Without limitation of the foregoing authority, the Council may:
(1)
Levy and collect taxes, special assessments, service charges, license charges, fees, and other revenues, and borrow money in such manner, and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.
(2)
Make appropriations for all parish purposes.
(3)
Require periodic and special reports from all parish officers concerning the affairs of their respective departments, offices, agencies, or special districts, which reports shall be submitted by and through the Parish President in the case of departments, offices, agencies, and special districts subject to his jurisdiction.
(4)
Make investigations of parish affairs by inquiring into the conduct of any department, office, agency, or special district of the parish, or of any person in the service of the parish, including the investigation of the accounts, records, and transactions of the department, office, agency, or special district and for these purposes subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, and require the production of books, papers, and other evidence; and any person who fails or refuses to obey any lawful order of the Council pursuant to this paragraph shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable in such manner as the Council shall fix by ordinance.
(5)
By ordinance, abolish or consolidate any parish department, office, or agency, or provide for the consolidation and transfer of any of the functions of such departments, offices, or agencies subject to Section 4.01B provided that:
(a)
The police powers of the Sheriff, including the power, authority, and duty to preserve the public peace and order, to apprehend all disturbers thereof, to prevent crime and to apprehend criminals, to protect the rights of persons and property, and to enforce the laws shall not be transferred or diminished and provided further that the Sheriff's functions as ex officio tax collector as provided in Article VII, Section 65 of the State Constitution [of 1921] shall not be diminished.
(b)
The power, authority, and duties of the Clerk of the District Court, Tax Assessor and the School Board shall continue as in existence at the time of the adoption of Article XIV, Section 3(c) of the State Constitution [of 1921), but subject to the general laws of the State with respect to Clerks of the District Courts, Tax Assessors, tax assessments, Parish School Boards, and public education.
(6)
Enter into contracts with other governmental units within or outside the boundaries of the parish for joint performance or performance by one unit in behalf of the other of any authorized function or activity.

By ordinance, establish, merge, and abolish special districts within which may be provided fire protection, recreation facilities, water, streets, sidewalks, street lighting, waste and garbage collection and disposal, sewerage and sewage disposal systems, drainage, and other essential facilities and services. All parish funds for such districts shall be provided by service charges, special assessments, general tax levies, or as otherwise provided by law, within such districts only. When acting as the governing body of special districts as provided in Section 6.01B the Parish Council shall have the same jurisdiction and powers as when acting as the Council.
(8)
Provide, in a manner and in amounts consistent with state law, penalties for the violation of this Charter and of parish ordinances.
(9)
Perform any other acts, consistent with law, deemed to be for the best interest of the people of the parish.

In accordance with Section 2.01(A)(4), investigate any person in the service of the parish for lack of qualifications, neglect of duty, failure to comply with a lawful directive of the Council or gross misconduct in reference to that person's duties. The allegations in support of the investigation shall be presented in writing to the appointing authority and to the affected officer or employee, and if the appointing authority does not take appropriate disciplinary actions, the Council may order a hearing thereon, at which the affected officer or employee and the appointing authority shall have the right to be heard, to be represented by counsel, and to require the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant books, papers, and other evidence. If, after hearing, the allegations against the affected officer or employee are confirmed, the officer or employee may be subjected to disciplinary action up to and including suspension or dismissal from parish service by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of the Council. The affected officer or employee may require that such hearing be held at an open meeting. The Council may by ordinance provide procedures for such investigations and hearings.
The provisions of this section shall neither diminish any authority of the Parish President, pursuant to Section 3.03(B) to remove any employee responsible to him, nor enhance any right of any unclassified officer or employee who serves at the pleasure of their appointing authority, nor preclude any right afforded elsewhere in this Charter or state law to employees in a classified service.
(B)
The Council shall have the power of eminent domain and the right to expropriate property for public purposes as provided by law. The Council shall make fair and just compensation for any properties acquired in the exercise of its powers, duties, or functions.
(Ord. No. 19100, 6-8-94; Ord. No. 23989, § 1, 4-6-11, eff. 1-1-12; Ord. No. 24820 , § 1, 9-3-14)
Annotation—Payment for expropriation of land two weeks after taking of physical possession by governmental body vitiates the proceeding as it violates the constitutional requirement that the land must be paid for before possession is taken. C. Tolmas, Inc. v. Parish Council, et al., 90 So. 2d 65 (La. 1956).
Editor's note— It should be noted that Ord. No. 24009, § 1, adopted May 11, 2011, provides, "Under and by virtue of the authority conferred by LSA Const. Art. 6 § 19, and Section 2.01(7) of the Jefferson Parish Home Rule Charter, a special service district be and is hereby created within the Parish to be known and designated as "Jefferson Parish Inspector General Special Services Funding District of the Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana," for the purpose of to providing, maintaining, administering and operating an office of inspector general and an ethics and compliance commission in the Parish. The District shall comprise and embrace all of that territory within the Parish Jefferson, State of Louisiana, less and except all of the territory situated within the corporate limits of the municipalities of Kenner, Harahan, Gretna, Westwego, Lafitte, and Grand Isle, as said corporate limits are presently constituted."

(A)
The parish shall be divided into five Council districts, the initial boundaries of which districts shall be established by Council ordinance until such time as they are reapportioned according to law.
(B)
Following official publication of the federal census by the United States Bureau of the Census and at least six months prior to the next election for Council members following publication of the census, the Council by ordinance shall, if necessary, alter, change or rearrange Council district boundaries so as to provide for population equality among districts as near as reasonably practicable. To the extent possible, Council districts shall be compact and composed of contiguous territory. In no event shall the number of districts or membership of the Council be increased or decreased except by amendment to the Charter.
(Ord. No. 19100, 6-8-94; Ord. No. 21621, § 3, 7-17-02)
Editor's note— The Jefferson Parish Council by Resolution No. 18717, adopted Aug. 12, 1971, approved and accepted the plan of reapportionment of the four-district, seven-man council as set out by judgment rendered by the United States District Court.
Annotation—Failure to observe Charter requirement that election be called for date less than sixty (60) days after adoption of resolution invalidated election at which citizens of parish voted to increase size of council. Even though Charter provides that redistricting could only be accomplished by amending Charter with voter approval, it was legally incumbent upon federal court to choose reapportionment plan where existing apportionment was constitutionally impermissible and failure of parish council to properly and timely call for an election had, as practical matter, made that procedure possible. James v. Jefferson Parish Council, 336 FS 270 (V.S. Dist. Ct., E.D. LA., N.O. Div. 1971).
Editor's note— It should be noted that Ord. No. 24015, § 1, adopted May 25, 2011, provides, "That the Jefferson Parish Council hereby adopts the plan of reapportionment for the Jefferson Parish Council districts as per map of said Council Districts which is attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference, under which plan of reapportionment the Jefferson Parish Council districts shall consist of the following precincts as those precincts are defined in Chapter 12 of the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances at the time of the adoption of this ordinance:

There shall be a Council consisting of seven members, two of whom shall be elected at large, and one each from and by each Council district. Except as provided in Paragraph 3 herein, a Council member shall be a qualified elector of the parish and shall have been legally domiciled and have actually resided in the parish for at least one year immediately preceding the time of qualifying for office in an area which, at the time of qualification, is within the district. The Council members elected from the Parish at large shall be designated as Councilmember-at-Large, Division A and Councilmember-at-Large, Division B. A candidate for the office of Councilmember-at-Large shall, at the time of his filing as a candidate, designate the one division of the two Councilmember-at-Large divisions for which he is a candidate.
2.
A Council member shall continue to be legally domiciled and to actually reside within the district from which elected during the term of office. Should the legal domicile and/or actual residence of a Council member change from the district from which elected, unless changed by reapportionment, the office shall automatically become vacant, which vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter.
3.
An elector may qualify as a candidate from any district created in whole or in part from a district existing prior to reapportionment if domiciled in that prior district for at least one year immediately preceding qualification.
4.
A Council member shall hold no other elected public office, nor any other compensated office or employment with the parish government during the term for which elected to the Council. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a Council member from serving as a member of a Charter commission, constitutional convention or political party committee.
(B)
Beginning in 1960 and every four years thereafter members of the Council shall be elected at the state general election in accordance with the election laws of the State. Upon receipt of their commission to office in accordance with the election laws of the state, members of the Council shall take their oath of office and assume the duties of their office even if the terms of office of incumbent councilmen are reduced to less than a full four (4) years.
(C)
The salary of Council members shall be determined by ordinance, provided that no ordinance changing the salaries of Council members shall be passed during the last year of the term and that a salary change shall not become effective during the current term of the Council members adopting the ordinance. The Council members shall not be entitled to sick leave or annual leave benefits.
(D)
A Council member who has served as a district Council member more than one and one-half terms in two consecutive terms shall not be eligible to qualify as a candidate for Council member for a district for the succeeding term.
A Council member who has served as a Councilmember-at-Large more than one and one-half terms in two consecutive terms shall not be eligible to qualify as a candidate for Council member elected at large for the succeeding term.
(Ord. No. 19100, 6-8-94; Ord. No. 21621, §§ 4, 6, 7-17-02; Ord. No. 24820 , § 2, 9-3-14)
Annotation—Five (5) days limitation on objections to a candidate is not an unconstitutional limitation on the Charter since fact that there are residence requirements in the Charter suggests that there must be same method available for challenging candidacy of person who does not possess such qualifications.

The electors of the parish shall have the power to propose to the Parish Council passage or repeal of ordinances and to vote on the question if the Council refuses action, according to the following procedure:
(1)
The person proposing the exercise of this power shall submit the proposal to the Council, which without delay shall specify a form of petition for circulation in one or multiple copies as the proposer may desire.
(2)
Within one month after the form of the petition shall have been specified, the person or persons circulating the petition shall obtain the signatures of at least ten percent of the total registered voters in the parish. There shall be noted after each signature on the petition the date signed and the address or district number of the signer.

The signed petition shall be filed with the Council within 60 days of the specification of the form of the petition, and within 30 days the Council shall order a canvass of the signatures thereon to determine the sufficiency and authenticity of the signatures. The Council's canvass shall be completed within 30 days. If the number of signatures is insufficient or the petition is deficient as to form or compliance with this section, the Council shall notify the person filing the petition and allow 30 days for filing of additional petition papers, at the end of which time the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petition shall be determined finally.

If the Council adopts an ordinance following the submission of an initiatory petition as provided in Section 5.01(4)(a) above, it shall not amend or repeal the ordinance by its own action, following the submission of a referendary petition submitted within one year, but shall submit the referendary proposal to a vote of the electors.
(6)
The vote of the electors, if required, shall take place within 120 days after the date the petition is presented to the Council, preferably in an election already scheduled for other purposes, otherwise in a special election. The result shall be determined by a majority vote of the electors voting on the proposal.

An ordinance proposed by initiatory petition or the repeal of an ordinance by referendary petition shall be effective 10 days after the election, except that:
(a)
Any reduction or elimination of existing revenue or any expenditures not provided for by the current budget or existing bond issues shall not take effect until the beginning of the next succeeding fiscal year; and
(b)
Should two or more ordinances adopted at the same election have conflicting provisions, the one receiving the highest number of votes shall prevail as to those provisions.
(8)
An ordinance adopted by the electorate through initiatory proceedings shall not be amended or repealed by the Council for a period of one year after the election at which it was adopted, but thereafter it may be amended or repealed as any other ordinance.
