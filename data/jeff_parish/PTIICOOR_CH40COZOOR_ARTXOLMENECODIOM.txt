The design guidelines for the Old Metairie Neighborhood Conservation District shall serve as a model for appropriate design and to acquaint property owners with the character of Old Metairie before any alterations to the property within the district are proposed. The Louisiana Speaks: Pattern Book, prepared for the Louisiana Recovery Authority by Urban Design Associates and released in 2006, shall supplement the design guidelines herein. The pattern book illustrates architectural styles commonly found in Louisiana and is available in electronic format or to review in hardcopy from the Planning Department of the Parish of Jefferson. Property owners or their design professionals shall use the design guidelines herein and the latest edition of the pattern book as a resource of guidelines for development and redevelopment within the Old Metairie Conservation District. The Old Metairie Commission shall use the design guidelines herein and the latest edition of the pattern book to identify elements deemed important and appropriate for the district in reviewing proposed alterations and construction, and as a basis for commission recommendations. This article recognizes the variety of architectural style in Old Metairie and that the guidelines contained herein may not be appropriate for all development proposals within the Old Metairie Neighborhood Conservation District.
(1)
General elements.
