Sales or exchanges of property shall be authorized by an ordinance adopted by the council which shall indicate:
(1)
That a determination has been made by the parish administrative staff that the property to be disposed of is no longer needed for public use;
(2)
That an appraisal of the property has been made by competent appraisers appointed by the parish; unless an equivalent appraisal or valuation has already recently been retained by the parish or the property is deemed to be substandard property. In the latter case, the property shall be sold at a fair price without necessity of formal appraisal but in no case for less than one dollar ($1.00) per square foot.
(a)
For purposes of this section, the property may be deemed "substandard" only if the entirety of the contiguous public property is either: (1) less than two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the minimum required square footage of a buildable lot under the applicable ordinances, regulations and/or other restrictions at the location, or (2) is not legally a buildable area because it has less than two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the minimum required street frontage for a buildable lot at the location under applicable ordinances, regulations and/or other restrictions.
(3)
A minimum price shall be set forth in the ordinance; and
(4)
In those cases involving sales or exchanges of any portion of a street, road, highway or alley, the parish attorney's office shall certify that the owner of the property adjacent to such portion of a street, road, highway or alley is not the original grantor or dedicator of such portion of the street, road, highway or alley, nor are the heirs of the original grantor or dedicator the abutting property owners.

In addition to procedures established by other provisions of this chapter for the alienation of surplus immovable property by the parish, the following procedures are established for the private sale of parish immovable property:
(1)
Upon a determination by the parish administrative staff that a certain parcel of parish property, not defined as substandard by the terms of this Code, is no longer needed for public purposes nor is likely to be needed for public purposes in the reasonably foreseeable future, the council may authorize the alienation of such property following an appraisal by a qualified real estate appraiser;
(2)
Following authorization by the council, the department of general services and procurement shall advertise the proposed alienation of such property and shall solicit offers from parties interested in acquiring said surplus immovable property;
(3)
The council may also commission a licensed state real estate broker to assist the department of general services and procurement in marketing said surplus property and soliciting offers of purchase;
(4)
No offer to purchase will be considered that does not equal or exceed the market value established in the report of the appraiser commissioned to evaluate said property. All offers to purchase will be accompanied by a ten (10) percent down payment which may be cash or certified check. If more than one (1) offer as set out in subsection (2) of this section above is received by the real estate broker which exceeds the value as set out in the appraisal report, the highest offer will be submitted for approval to the parish council;
(5)
An ordinance authorizing the sale and declaring the property no longer needed for public purpose shall fully describe the property including setting out the appraised value, the name of the proposed purchaser, and the amount of the highest offer received for the property and shall be submitted after compliance with the above paragraphs. All costs for any required resubdivision and surveys in connection therewith will be borne by the purchaser, at or prior to the execution of the sale;
(6)
For the purposes of this section the term "alienation" shall include but not be limited to sale, exchange and any other type of transfer of any right, title or interest in such surplus immovable property.

Prior to any sale of immovable property owned by the parish or by any special district or agency administered by the parish or by the public and administered by the parish, any person who is considering the purchase of such property may have the property surveyed and/or appraised at his own cost. Prior to any survey or appraisal authorized herein, however, the person requesting the survey or appraisal must first execute an agreement approved by the parish attorney to hold Jefferson Parish harmless from any liability which it may otherwise incur from the conducting of the survey or appraisal.
