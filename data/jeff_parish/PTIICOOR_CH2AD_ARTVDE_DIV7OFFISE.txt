Editor's note— Prior to their amendment by § 1 of Ord. No. 16844, adopted Apr. 30, 1986, §§ 2-211—2-213 related to the department and director of fire and emergency services and were derived from Code 1961, §§ 2-280—2-283. The editor has deleted the term "and emergency services" from the division title to more accurately reflect the contents of the division. Emergency services are now covered by Div. 8 of this article. Subsequently, Ord. No. 21966, § 1, adopted Aug. 6, 2003, amended the title of Div. 7 from "department of fire" to "office of fire services." Ord. No. 22692, § 1, adopted February 8, 2006, amended Div. 7 by changing the title of "superintendent of fire" to "director of fire." See also the Code Comparative Table.
