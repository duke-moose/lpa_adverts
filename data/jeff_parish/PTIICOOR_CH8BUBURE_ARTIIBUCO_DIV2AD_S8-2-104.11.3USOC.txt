A building or portion thereof shall not be used or occupied nor shall a change in the nature of use or occupancy of a building or portion thereof, be made until the code official has issued such written authorization (See also section 101.5.2).
Where permitted construction work has been completed, the issued certificate of completion shall authorize use and occupancy. In cases where there is no permitted or code-required construction work associated with the intended use, the zoning clearance form shall serve to authorize use and occupancy in compliance with the zoning district regulations.
