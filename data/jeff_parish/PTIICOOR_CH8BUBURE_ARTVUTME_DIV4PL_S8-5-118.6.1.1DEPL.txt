Where there are valid reasons to believe that the plumbing system of any premise or building is defective, it shall be subject to test and inspection. Upon evidence that such plumbing does not comply with this Code, the owner shall be required to have all defective plumbing corrected as required, in writing, by the code official. After due notice, failure of the owner to comply, shall give the Jefferson Parish Plumbing Section the right to order the discontinuance of water and/or sewer services to the property involved. The services shall remain discontinued until all requirements of the plumbing code have been met.
