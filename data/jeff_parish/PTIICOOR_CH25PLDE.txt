(a)
Purpose. The purpose of the consistency doctrine is to merge intentions and actions. Jefferson Parish recognizes that two (2) key expressions of intentions and actions, and powerful tools for implementing this plan, are the capital improvement program, including the schedule of capital improvement projects and the capital budget, and land development regulations, particularly zoning and subdivision. Generally, the parish aims to take actions that are consistent with the plan's intentions.
(b)
Capital improvement program. Annually, the parish adopts and amends its capital improvement program and capital budget to repair and replace existing infrastructure and facilities; meet needs in developed, developing, and redeveloping areas; coordinate the activities of various departments; and ultimately influence the quality of life and development in the parish, all in accordance with the plan.
(c)
Development regulations. As applied to land development regulations, the consistency requirement reflects the planning assumption that significant plan implementation occurs through the local regulatory framework zoning, subdivision, and related land development regulations and the individual development decisions that are legislative, quasi-judicial, or ministerial. Decision-making reflects the diversity of plan goals and objectives which sometimes compete, and this circumstance frames the following provisions for consistency findings:
(1)
Land development regulations and legislative land use actions (as defined in chapter 33 of this Code) shall be consistent with the comprehensive plan.
(2)
Before the parish council, planning advisory board (PAB), or Old Metairie Commission (OMC) may take any land use action, the planning director shall make a finding regarding consistency with the plan in the written report. The consistency finding shall be advisory and state whether, in the opinion of the planning director, the land use action is consistent with the plan.
(3)
The planning director shall determine that a proposed land use action is consistent with the plan when the land use action:
a.
Furthers, or at least does not interfere with, the vision, goals, and objectives of the plan;
b.
Is compatible with:
1.
The vision, goals, and objectives of the plan;
2.
The future land use map, if applicable; or
3.
Any relevant issues or opportunities described in the plan; or
c.
Carries out, as applicable, any specific implementation task of the plan.
(4)
If the planning director determines that the proposed land use action is not consistent with the plan, she:
a.
Shall state in the written report the reason(s) for the finding; and
b.
May state in the written report:
1.
Any changes or revisions to the proposed land use action that would make it consistent with the plan; or
2.
Any amendments to the plan that would eliminate the inconsistency between the plan and the proposed land use action, including amendments to the FLUM that may be considered concurrent with the proposed land use action or as part of monitoring and review of the plan.
(5)
The parish council, PAB, or OMC shall, upon receipt of the written report, review the consistency finding, giving the finding due regard in its deliberations. If in its deliberations the parish council, PAB, or OMC disagrees with a finding of the planning director regarding consistency with the plan and rejects the finding in its recommendation or decision, it should state:
a.
Other goals, objectives, or tasks of the plan that its recommendation or decision supports;
b.
Any changes or revisions in the proposed land use action that would make it consistent with the plan; or
c.
Any amendments to the plan that would eliminate an inconsistency between the plan and the proposed land use action.

(1)

(2)

To ensure that the plan remains an effective guide for the parish, the planning director, with assistance from other departments, shall perform periodic evaluations of the goals, objectives, and implementation tasks of the plan.
(1)
Monitoring. On an annual basis and in conjunction with the budget cycle, the council may review the plan and the effect of any significant changes that may have occurred within the parish. The planning director shall prepare an annual report, which may be used to refine implementation tasks and budgetary considerations, that:
a.
Describes the status of the plan implementation program;
b.
Identifies any obstacles, policy gaps, and needed policy clarifications or amendments; and
c.
Identifies any new opportunities to achieve plan goals.
(2)
Review. Based on the findings of the annual report, the planning director may recommend a comprehensive review and update of the plan. If specific plan tasks are not funded over a period of five (5) or more years, the parish council should evaluate whether the tasks should be omitted from the plan. When there is a continuous conflict between funded activities and the plan, the council should consider whether those goals or objectives remain valid or need to be revised to reflect changing needs and conditions. The council shall review the plan as a whole at least once every five (5) years. This review shall consider, but not be limited to, the following data and analysis:
a.
The relevance of the vision, goals, and objectives and community support for them;
b.
The parish's success in carrying out implementation tasks and reasons for any lack of success;
c.
Changes in issues and conditions that affect the parish and form the basis of the plan;
d.
Fiscal conditions and the ability or desire to finance public projects, programs, and services identified in the plan; and
e.
Changes in state or federal laws, funding, or programs that affect the parish's tools for plan implementation.
