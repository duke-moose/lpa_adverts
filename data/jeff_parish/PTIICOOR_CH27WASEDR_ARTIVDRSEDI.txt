(a)
Policy statement.
(1)
The sanitary sewerage system exists to provide for the collection of polluted wastewater from public and private property and its treatment through normal sewage treatment practices. It is in the public interest that reasonable rules and regulations be applied to discharges into the sanitary sewerage systems to prevent the system from being unnecessarily or excessively burdened, and to ensure that effluent from the sanitary sewerage system will comply with all applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations.
(2)
Proper operation of the sanitary sewerage system requires, among other things, the prohibition of any discharge components which would not be compatible with, or which would be harmful to or would interfere with the system. Proper operation of the system also requires that the system not be burdened with storm water runoff and similar wastewater which should be discharged through the storm drainage system. Safe operation of the system also requires that discharges of toxic substances and other harmful materials into the system be prohibited.
(b)
General prohibitions and limitations. No person shall cause or permit any discharge into the sanitary sewerage system containing any pollutant or other material of such character or quality that will:
(1)
Not be susceptible to or compatible with treatment by the system, or interfere with or damage the system or its efficient operation thereof;
(2)
Constitute a hazard to human life, or to the stream or watercourse receiving the effluent;
(3)
Violate any pretreatment standard or effluent limitation as defined herein;
(4)
Cause the system to violate any applicable LPDES permit or any applicable water quality standard;
(5)
Violate any of the specific prohibitions or limitations established by subsection (c) of this section;
(6)
Cause pass through at the POTW.
(c)
Specific prohibitions and limitations. No person shall cause or permit any discharge into the sanitary sewerage system which at the point of connection to the system contains any of the following:
(1)
Unpolluted water. Any unpolluted water, including but not limited to storm water, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, or nonchemically treated cooling water. These waters shall be discharged into the storm drainage system, as they would constitute an unnecessary burden upon the sanitary sewerage system.
(2)
Fats, oil or grease.
a.
Edible fat, oil or grease, at a concentration of more than one hundred seventy-five (175) mg/l whether emulsified or not.
b.
Deposit fats, oil, or grease in the sewer lines in such a manner as to clog the sewers or impede the flow;
c.
Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through or at a concentration of more than one hundred (100) mg/l.
(3)
Explosive mixtures. Liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW, including but not limited to wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than one hundred forty (140) degrees Fahrenheit or sixty (60) degrees Centigrade using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. At no time shall two (2) successive readings on a U.S. Bureau of Mines approved explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the sewer system, be more than five (5) percent nor any single reading over ten (10) percent of the lower explosive limit of the meter.
(4)
Noxious material. Noxious or malodorous solids, liquids or gases, which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are capable of creating a public nuisance or hazard to human life, or are or may be sufficient to prevent entry into a sewer for its maintenance and repair. In no event shall any waste be discharged in such concentrations as to affect the taste and odor of the receiving stream after passage through the sewage treatment process.
(5)
Color. Wastes causing discoloration not readily removable by the normal sewage treatment process.
(6)

(a)
Reports. The following types of reports may be required to be submitted depending on the type of industrial user and compliance history:
(1)
Industrial dischargers are required to file sampling results on an industrial user self-monitoring report form supplied by the department. The director shall require each significant discharger to monitor the facility's discharge and report the results of said monitoring at specified intervals, no less than once every six (6) months. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the control authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the control authority must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is not required if;
(i)
The control authority performs the sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month; or
(ii)
The control authority performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the control authority receives the results of this sampling.
(2)
Baseline monitoring reports shall include the following: Nature of the process, volume, rates of flow, volume of water irreversibly used in production, hours of operation, concentrations of controlled pollutants, or other information which relates to the generation of wastes. Such reports may also include the chemical constituents and quantity of liquid materials stored on site even though they are not normally discharged;
(3)
Compliance schedule progress reports;
(4)
Compliance with categorical deadline;
(5)
Periodic compliance reports from categorical industrial users:
a.
Any industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standards, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit control authority during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the control authority or by the approval authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such categorical pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average or maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the discharge required by the control authority. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation required by the control authority or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. At the discretion of the control authority and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the control authority may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted;
b.
Where the control authority has imposed mass limitations on industrial users as provided for by 40 CFR 403.6(d), the report required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards imposed on the industrial user;
c.
For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the control authority in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c) the report required by paragraph (5)(a) shall contain a reasonable measures of the user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by paragraph (5)(a) shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period;
(6)
Notice of changed discharge: All industrial users shall promptly notify the control authority (and the POTW if the POTW is not the control authority) thirty (30) days in advance, in writing, of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p) (see LAC 33:IX.6123.P.);
(7)
Notice of hazardous waste to sewer;
(8)
Notice of potential problems including slug loading: All categorical and non-categorical industrial users shall notify the control authority and the POTW immediately of all discharges that could cause problems to the POTW including any slug loadings, as defined by 40 CFR 403.5(b) and LAC 33:IX.6109.B., by the industrial user. In the case of any discharge, including but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the control authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user;
(9)
Periodic compliance reports from non-categorical industrial users. Significant non-categorical industrial users shall submit to the control authority at least once every six (6) months (on dates specified by the control authority) a description of the nature, concentration and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the control authority. In cases where a local limit requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the control authority to determine the compliance status of the user. These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR 136 (see LAC 33:IX.4901) and amendments thereto. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the control authority in lieu of the significant non-categorical industrial user.
(b)
Records: All persons who discharge or propose to discharge industrial waste may be required to maintain such records as effluent flows and pollutant concentrations as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this division and with any applicable pretreatment standards. Such records shall be made available upon request by the director.
(c)
Monitoring:
(1)
The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging industrial wastes may be required to install at his own expense suitable monitoring equipment, including but not limited to, control manholes and/or sampling ports with approved meters and appurtenances to facilitate accurate observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. Such equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times;
(2)
The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the industrial disposal premises outside the building. When such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the director may allow a facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such street or sidewalk, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles. All sampling ports shall be constructed above ground and not subject to any ground or rain water infiltration or dilution. All manholes shall be leak-proof and not subject to any ground or rain water infiltration or dilution;
(3)
When the discharge from an individual discharger enters the parish sewerage system at more than one (1) location, the director may require said discharger to provide current discharge rates occurring at each discharge point. Such discharge rates, expressed as a percentage of the total flow, shall be established by measurement or approved estimate;
(4)
When more than one (1) discharger can discharge into a common sewer, the director may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each. When there is a significant difference in wastewater characteristics produced by different operations of a single discharger, the director may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate operation.
(5)
Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the director's requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
(d)
Frequency of monitoring. The director shall require each significant discharger to monitor his discharge and report the results of such monitoring at specified intervals. For industrial dischargers not categorized as significant, the director may establish a self-monitoring and reporting schedule, as deemed appropriate for that industry and the characteristics of its discharge.
(e)
Pollutants to be monitored. The director shall provide to each discharger who is determined to require self-monitoring a complete list of wastewater constituents for which the discharger must provide monitoring. The director shall provide to the discharger information regarding discharge prohibitions and limitations for pollutants to be self-monitored.
(f)
Inspection, sampling and analysis.
(1)
Compliance determination. Compliance determinations with respect to section 27-146 prohibitions and limitations may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater. Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-four-hour period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined necessary by the director to meet the needs of specific circumstances. All sampling shall be conducted in accordance with the methods described in 40 CFR 136;
(2)
Analysis of industrial wastewaters. Laboratory analyses of industrial wastewater samples shall be performed in accordance with the procedures described in 40 CFR 136. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the 40 CFR Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the control authority or other parties approved by the EPA. If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in 27-149(a) of this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the control authority, using the procedures prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
(3)
[Reserved.]
(g)
Reporting of accidental discharges. If, for any reason, a discharger does not comply with any prohibition or limitations in this division, the discharger shall immediately notify the director so that corrective action may be taken to protect the sanitary sewerage system. In addition, a written report addressed to the director detailing the date, time and cause of the accidental discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the discharge within five (5) days of the occurrence of the noncompliance.
(h)
Record-keeping requirements.
(1)
Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall maintain records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this section. Such records shall include for all samples:
(i)
The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the names of the person or persons taking the samples;
(ii)
The dates analyses were performed;
(iii)
Who performed the analyses;
(iv)
The analytical techniques/methods use; and
(v)

(1)
Revocation of permit and termination of service. Prior to the suspension or revocation of a permit and the termination of public works services, the director shall notify the holder of the permit in writing. Said notice shall advise that the parish will consider the suspension or revocation of the permit, termination of service or disconnection. Said notice shall state the date of proposed suspension or revocation, termination of service and proposed disconnection of service, the reason therefore, and the time, date and place that the director shall hold a hearing upon the proposed suspension or revocation, termination or disconnection. Such hearing shall not be less than ten (10) days subsequent to the receipt of notice. Said notice shall be mailed to the owner at the address shown on the permit application or as known to the department. A copy may be delivered to the permit holder or the person in charge of the facility or posted conspicuously on the property affected. The parish may (but shall not be required to) give such further additional notice as in the discretion of the director or parish attorney is convenient or desirable. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the director shall determine whether grounds exist for suspension or revocation, for termination and/or for disconnection of service. If such grounds are found to exist, the permit shall forthwith be suspended or revoked and service shall forthwith be terminated and sanitary and waste disposal and water facilities forthwith disconnected. A copy of said decision shall be sent by certified mail to the owner at the address shown on the permit or as known to the director, and a copy shall be delivered to the facility or posted conspicuously on the property. The service of said copy of the decision shall not be a condition precedent or subsequent to suspension or revocation, termination or disconnection.
(e)
Restoration of service. Any person whose permit has been suspended or revoked, or for whom service has been terminated or disconnected, may petition the director for reinstatement of the permit and reinstatement of service.
(1)

All food service operations shall install, at their own expense, a grease control device of the size and type specified by the director of code enforcement as required. Compliance with this section will be required by the FSO discharging fats, oil or grease into the sewerage system regardless of whether that discharger is the owner or lessee of a property. There will be a grace period to allow FSOs to come into compliance. No enforcement action will be taken for six (6) months after adoption of this ordinance by the parish council. Specifically, those FSOs required to have grease control devices shall comply with the following provisions:
(1)
General provisions:
a.
All grease control devices shall be kept free of inorganic solid material such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could inhibit the design performance of the grease control device;
b.
All FSOs are required to maintain their grease control device in good working order and in accordance with any manufacturer's specifications;
c.
After twelve (12) months of documented compliance with this section, an FSO may appeal to the director of the department of environmental affairs to reduce the cleaning frequency of its grease control device;
d.
All food service operations shall operate grease control devices in a manner such that the discharge limit specified in section 27-146(c)2.a is consistently achieved. "Consistent" shall mean that any wastewater sample taken from the grease control device effluent will contain fats, oil or grease in concentrations no greater than those specified in section 27-146(c)2.a.
1.
The parish reserves the right to collect samples at any time during normal business hours to verify compliance with section 27-146 and reserves the right to require an FSO to collect and analyze samples at their own expense. Prior to collecting samples, the department of environmental affairs must approve the sampling time, location, and analytes. Right of entry shall be provided during normal business hours for the purpose of sample collection or inspection. Copies of analytical results shall be mailed by FSO to the parish within two (2) weeks of receipt of results with a cover letter certifying that the FSO acknowledges the analytical results;
2.
In the event that additional techniques are required to verify compliance, including but not limited to remote sewer line inspection, the cost for these techniques shall be borne by the food service operation if he is found to be out of compliance;
e.
Grease, wastewater, and/or solids removed from a grease control device and treated on or off-site shall not be reintroduced into the grease control device;
f.
Under no circumstances shall grease, wastewater and/or sludge removed from a grease control device be introduced into the sanitary sewer system or storm drainage system;
g
The use of additives, i.e. bacteria, chemical additives, (including but not limited to acids, bleach, etc.), or enzymes, the sole purpose of which is to remove fats, oil, or grease from the grease control device is strictly prohibited. Removal of accumulated fats, oil or grease shall only be accomplished through physical or mechanical methods.
(2)
Grease traps:
a.
For grease traps, remove, at the users expense, the entire contents of the grease trap, including any accumulated grease layer, wastewater, and solids, as often as required to comply with the provisions of section 27-146(c)2.a but at intervals of not longer than thirty (30) days;
b.
All FSOs shall maintain on the premises one (1) year of records, including the current FSO discharge permit and completed fats, oil or grease manifest forms that document the cleaning of grease traps in accordance with this section. Manifests shall be provided by the permitted fats, oil or grease waste hauler at the time of cleaning. All such records shall be available for inspection by the parish during normal business hours.
(3)
Above ground fats, oil or grease interceptors: Establishments using above ground fats, oil or grease interceptors that must be manually cleaned shall maintain local records, for a period of one (1) year, reflecting the cleaning of the fats, oil or grease interceptor. Each fats, oil or grease interceptor must be cleaned at a minimum of once every seven (7) days of operation. The local records will contain the name, printed, of the person cleaning the fats, oil or grease interceptor, the date of cleaning, the time of cleaning and disposal method, and the signature of the cleaner verifying completion. Fats, oil or grease removed from such a device will be disposed of properly.
(4)
Grease removal devices: Should a food service operation be approved by the director of code enforcement to use a grease removal device (GRD), it is required to obtain a maintenance and service contract with a qualified service provider to render maintenance and inspection of the GRD in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations and specifications. The establishment must maintain a copy of its maintenance contract on-site and provide a copy to the director of the department of environmental affairs. Also, the establishment must maintain inspection and servicing documents for the GRD for a period of one (1) year.
(5)
Enforcement:
a.
Failure to comply with any of the above provisions or with the permit conditions will result in a maximum fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or a maximum of thirty (30) days imprisonment or both. Each day of a violation shall be treated as a separate offense. Federal offenses for violation of the Clean Water Act will be considered, if appropriate, and forwarded on to the responsible federal agency for prosecution. The provisions for issuance of a compliance order in section 27-151(b) and termination of service in section 27-151(d) also apply;
b.
The administrative adjudication hearing officer shall have the authority to enforce the requirements of this ordinance, as stipulated in Chapter 2.5, section 2.54 of this Code. An official of the administrative adjudication bureau shall be authorized to post a violation notice at the main business entrance of a violator's establishment, indicating the nature of the violation occurring on the premises. Such a notice can only be removed by an authorized Jefferson Parish official. Removal of such a sign by any other party will itself be considered a violation, and the presumption will be made in favor of the parish that it was removed by an authorized agent of the violator. The environmental affairs department shall have the authority to notify the Jefferson Parish Water Department to terminate water services to violators of this article.
c.
None of the penalties listed in section 27-152 exclude or supersede the penalties provided by state and federal law.

10 34,700.00
  (b)
Minimum charge. A minimum for all industrial user accounts as defined in section 27-143 is hereby established and assessed at the rate of one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) for monthly accounts and three dollars ($3.00) for bimonthly accounts. This minimum charge applies to the first three thousand (3,000) gallons or less of metered water consumption for monthly accounts and six thousand (6,000) gallons or less of metered water consumption for bimonthly accounts.
(c)
Monthly service charge. These fees are defined and assessed for all accounts to the following schedule:

8 25.72 51.43
10 35.15 70.29
12 41.15 82.29
  (d)
Volume rate charges:
(1)
Industrial user volume charge. This fee is to be calculated for each sewerage connection account with the exception food service operations as defined in section 27-143 and those assessed a volume charge in section 27-48(c). This fee shall be based on one hundred (100) percent of total metered water consumption, as indicated by the water meter reading, less product usage as defined in section 27-143 at a rate of one dollar ($1.00) per [one] thousand (1,000) gallons. The formula for computing the volume charge shall be:
(Q t - P) × Rate (as established above) = C v
Where:
Q t = Total metered water consumption per billing period in thousands of gallons.
P = Product usage per billing period in thousands of gallons, as established by the discharger to the satisfaction of the director. Where the discharger fails to so establish its product usage, the value of P shall be zero. It shall be the duty of the discharger to submit such records, which shall be accurate and complete, to the director as he may require, to enable the director to properly assess the charge.
C v = Amount charged based on volume of water consumed.
(2)
Food service operation volume charge. All food service operations as defined in section 27-143 discharging into the sanitary sewerage system shall be assessed a volume rate charge based on seventy-five (75) percent of total metered water consumption, as indicated by the water meter reading, at a rate of one dollar ($1.00) per [one] thousand gallons. The formula for computing the volume charge shall be:
Q t × Rate (as established above) = C v
Where:
Q t = Total metered water consumption per billing period in thousands of gallons.
Q v = Amount charged based on volume of water consumed.
(e)
Excessive strength charge (ESC). This charge is an additional sewerage service charge levied on all industrial users, excluding food service operations, who discharge into the sanitary sewerage system any waste of higher strength than that of domestic sewerage as defined in section 27-143 and is intended to defray the added cost of treating higher strength waste. ESC shall be calculated based on excessive BOD and excessive TSS. In those instances where the wastewater discharger has a COD concentration greater than or equal to two and one-half (2.50) times that of the BOD concentration, the ESC shall be calculated based on the excessive COD. The director may require the discharger to provide data demonstrating the treatability of such wastewater. The ESC shall be computed according to the following formula:
ESC = (V - P) × 0.00834 × [a(BOD - 500) + b(TSS - 250)]
Alternatively, if COD is greater than or equal to 2.5 times BOD ESC = (V - P) × 0.00834 × [a(COD - 500 + b(TSS - 250)]
Where:
V = Metered water volume per billing period in thousands of gallons
P = Product usage per billing period in thousands of gallons
0.00834 = Constant to convert milligrams per liter to pounds per thousand gallons
200 = Milligrams per liter of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) allowed in wastewater with no excessive strength charge
250 = Milligrams per liter of total suspended solids (TSS) allowed in wastewater with no excessive strength charge
500 = Milligrams per liter of chemical oxygen demand (COD) allowed in wastewater with no excessive strength charge
a = Unit cost of treatment per pound of BOD and COD
b = Unit cost of treatment per pound of TSS
BOD = Concentration of BOD in discharger's waste effluent, expressed in mg/l
TSS = Concentration of TSS in discharger's waste effluent, expressed in mg/l
COD = Concentration of COD in discharger's waste effluent, expressed in mg/l
(1)
All required sampling for the determination of ESC shall be done in accordance with section 27-152.2.
(2)
If an industrial user has a wastewater discharge permit, provisions regarding ESC, including, but not limited to, sampling location and monitoring frequency, stated in their wastewater discharge permit take precedence.
(3)
Excessive strength charges (ESC) for industrial users classified by the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual, published by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, as SIC Code 2086 that are primarily engaged in the manufacturing of bottled and canned soft drinks and carbonated waters shall be computed according to the following formula:
ESC = (V - P) × 0.00834 × [c(BOD - 200) + b(TSS - 250)]
Where:
c = the current charge
the terms V, P, BOD, b and TSS are defined in section 27-152(e).
The base charge for a, b and c will be adjusted annually beginning January 1, 2002, based on the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. The annual adjustment will equal a U.S. City Average 12 month percentage change in the All Urban Consumers—All Items Index (CPI-U) as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI adjusted charges are published annually in the Official Journal of Jefferson Parish and in the Progressive Jefferson, the publication ordinarily accompanying the water bills themselves.
(f)
Monitoring and surveillance fee, food service operations.
(1)
All food service operations, regardless of the type of grease control device installed, are required to obtain an annual discharge permit or permit renewal through the department of environmental affairs and shall comply with all provisions of the permit. Permits are not transferable. A monitoring and surveillance fee not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00) per year per FSO shall be assessed during the processing of the permit or permit renewal in order to recoup the costs of administering this program including but not limited to time and materials spent assigning permits and inspecting FSOs. The following food service operations shall be exempt from the monitoring and surveillance fee:
a.
Schools, kindergarten through 12th grade, including public, private, and parochial;
b.
Day care facilities;
c.
Churches, religious institutions, and not-for-profit food distribution centers such as homeless shelters;
d.
Not for profit nursing homes.
(2)
Exemption. If, in the opinion of the director of the department of environmental affairs, a food service operation does not discharge fats, oil or grease during the conduct of business, an exemption to the monitoring and surveillance fee may be issued. However, this does not exempt the user from the requirement to obtain a discharge permit under section 27-152. At least one (1) time per year and no later than September 30th of a given year, the director of the department of sewerage shall submit to the director of public works an estimate of the costs incurred in clearing blockages caused by fats, oil or grease in the sewerage collection system for the last twelve-month period.

(a)
Assessment of ESC may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater, as determined by the director. ESC shall be determined using an average value for each relevant parameter. This average shall be determined using all acceptable data, both self-monitoring and parish monitoring, available, on a quarterly basis, at the time of billing. The director shall determine the acceptability of data.
(b)
Samples must be collected during normal business operating hours and must be representative of typical wastewater discharge from a facility. The facility must wait at least five (5) days after maintenance of any pretreatment device before sample collection may occur.
(c)
All sampling and analysis shall be conducted in accordance with the methods described in 40 CFR 136.
(d)
All analytical results must be submitted on the "Industrial User Self-Monitoring Report" form. The department of environmental affairs will provide these forms as requested.
(e)
If an industrial user monitors any parameter at the designated sampling location more frequently than required, using test procedures approved under 40 CFR Part 136, the results of this monitoring shall be reported within two (2) weeks of receipt of results to the Jefferson Parish Department of Environmental Affairs.
(f)
The director shall establish the discharge location where the ESC is to be assessed and all sampling required for determining ESC shall take place at this location. If, in the opinion of the director, a suitable sampling port is not present, the industrial user shall install, at his own expense, such a port.
(g)
The parish may, at any time, collect samples of the discharge from an industrial user to assess the validity of established surcharge parameter values and/or to determine compliance with local limits defined in subdivision. If samples results indicate a significant deviation from previously established surcharge parameter values, those results may be used to modify the ESC in order to reflect prevailing conditions. If sample results indicate an exceedance of any local limit, the director may require the facility to take whatever action is deemed necessary to bring the facility into compliance.

Prohibitions and limitations on discharges into the sanitary sewerage system.
(1)
Policy statement.
a.
The sanitary sewerage system exists to provide for the collection of polluted wastewater from public and private property and its treatment through normal sewage treatment practices. It is in the public interest that reasonable rules and regulations be applied to discharges into the sanitary sewerage system to prevent the system from being unnecessarily or excessively burdened, and to insure that effluent from the sanitary sewerage system will comply with all applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations;
b.
Proper operation of the sanitary sewerage system requires, among other things, the prohibition of any discharge components which would not be compatible with, or which would be harmful to, or would interfere with the system. Proper operation of the system also requires that the system not be burdened with stormwater and similar wastewater which should be discharged into the storm drainage system. Safe operation of the system also requires that discharges of toxic substances and other harmful materials into the system be prohibited.
(2)
General prohibitions and limitations. No person shall cause or permit any discharge into the sanitary sewerage system containing any pollutant or other material of such character or quality that will:
a.
Not be susceptible to or compatible with treatment by the system, or interfere with or damage the system or its efficient operation thereof;
b.
Constitute a hazard to human life, or to the stream or water course receiving the effluent;
c.
Violate any effluent limitation as defined herein;
d.
Cause the system to violate any applicable NPDES or LWDPS permit or any applicable water quality standard;
e.
Violate any of the specific prohibitions or limitations established by section 27-153(d)(3);
f.
Cause pass through at the POTW.
(3)
Specific prohibitions and limitations. No person shall cause or permit any discharge into the sanitary sewerage system which, at the point of discharge to the system, contains any of the following:
a.
Wastewater. Any wastewater generated outside of Jefferson Parish is temporarily allowed.
b.
Unpolluted water. Any unpolluted water including but not limited to stormwater, surface water, ground water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, or non-chemically treated cooling water.
