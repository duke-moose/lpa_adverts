The purpose of this district is to provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for certain types of business and wholesaling relatively free from offense, in modern landscaped buildings, to make available more attractive locations for these businesses and industries, and to provide opportunities for employment closer to places of residence with corresponding reduction of travel time from home to work. Certain commercial uses are permitted, primarily for service to employees in the district. Typical development in the district would be that which is commonly known as an Office-Warehouse Park.
