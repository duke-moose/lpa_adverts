(1)
The special flood hazard areas and local flood hazard areas of the parish are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental service, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2)
Flood losses may be avoided by development standards described in this chapter including elevating new construction safely above the recognized flood hazard and minimizing cumulative effect of encroachments in special and local flood hazard areas, which may increase flood heights and velocities.

It is the principal purpose of this section to prescribe minimum requirements for land use and control measures for flood-prone areas in the parish as determined by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). These regulations are based upon relevant technical storm data specific to the parish, as developed by the U.S. Corps of Engineers for the Federal Insurance Administration. These measures must be applied uniformly throughout the community to all privately and publicly owned land within flood-prone areas based upon standards set forth in these regulations as prescribed by the Federal Insurance Administration. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Protect human life and health; and
(2)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; and
(3)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; and
(4)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
(5)
Minimize damage to public facilities located in special flood hazard areas and local flood hazard areas; and
(6)
Ensure that current flood hazard data is available for property owners, prospective buyers, insurance agents, real estate agents, and other interested parties; and
(7)
Ensure that those who develop in special flood hazard areas or local flood hazard areas do so pursuant to this chapter; and
(8)
Ensure that those who develop special flood hazard areas or local flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit development which is dangerous to health, safety, and property due to flood hazards, or which result in damaging increases in flood heights or velocities; and
(2)
Require that development vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such development, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; and
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwater or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

In all areas of special flood hazards, the following provisions for permits are required for all new construction and substantial damage/improvement to ensure sites are reasonably safe from flooding:
(1)
Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the building resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads including the effects of buoyancy. All manufactured homes shall also meet the standards of section 14-6.5.
(2)
Construction materials and methods. All new construction and substantial damage/improvement shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage and using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during flooding.
(3)
Tanks. Underground and above-ground tanks shall be designed, constructed, installed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement resulting from floodwater loads, including the effects of buoyancy, hydrostatic pressure, and velocity. Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets, and vents shall be installed one foot above the base flood elevation or fitted with covers designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater and outflow of the contents of the tank during the base flood.
(4)
Foundations. Foundations and walls constructed below the base flood elevation shall be vented to equalize hydrostatic pressures.
(5)
Vents. Vent openings shall be permanent openings in the walls that allow for the free passage of water automatically in both directions without human intervention. Such venting shall be on at least two (2) sides of the structure, or enclosure, have a bottom at no more than one foot above the ground elevation. The total area of such venting shall be at least one square inch per square foot of enclosed footprint. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or automated float control in accordance with FEMA Technical Bulletin TB #1-08 Foundations and walls below the base flood elevation shall be constructed of flood resistant materials in accordance with FEMA Technical Bulletin TB #2-08. Alternatively, the project proponent may submit a design that will allow for automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls, signed and stamped by a registered civil engineer and approved by the floodplain administrator. A window, a door, or a garage door is not considered a vent opening. If there are multiple enclosed areas within the foundation, each area must be vented as herewith described.
(6)
Non-conversion. In areas outside HSDRRS for residential structures, whenever there is a crawlspace height of more than five (5) feet between top of bottom floor and top of next higher floor or highest adjacent (finished) grade and top of bottom floor a declaration of land use restriction shall be executed and recorded in the conveyance book with the Jefferson Parish Clerk of Court, to put current and future occupants of a building on notice that the area below the base flood elevation may not be finished or converted to living space and that the space may only be used as limited storage, building access, and vehicle parking. The declaration of land use restriction shall be in a form acceptable to the floodplain administrator and Parish Attorney's Office. The floodplain administrator shall have the right to inspect annually for conversion with 72-hour notice.

c.
In situations which could result in an undue delay in construction when all of the above conditions have been met and the requested variance will not increase the cost of the flood insurance, the board may grant a variance.
(4)
In order to execute the above mentioned powers, the board of standards and appeals may reverse or affirm wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination of the director, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matters on which it is required to pass under this chapter.
