The following words and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them:
Airport means the New Orleans International Airport.
Airport elevation means the highest point of the airport's usable landing area measured in feet from sea level (four (4) feet above means sea level).
Approach surface means a surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline, extending outward and upward from the end of the primary surface and at the same slope as the approach zone height limitation slope set forth in section 3-14. In the plan on file in the clerk's office the perimeter of the approach surface coincides with the perimeter of the approach zone.
Approach, transitional, horizontal and conical zones mean those zones set forth in section 3-13.
Aviation board of adjustment means a board consisting of seven (7) members appointed by the respective political subdivisions and by the New Orleans Aviation Board.
Conical surface means a surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of twenty (20) to one (1) for a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet.
Director of aviation means the director of aviation for the New Orleans International Airport or the official representative appointed by the New Orleans Aviation Board to administer permit applications affecting air navigation.
Hazard to air navigation means an obstruction determined to have a substantial adverse effect on the safe and efficient utilization of the navigable airspace.
Height: For the purposes of determining the height limitations in all zones set forth in this article and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.
Horizontal surface means a horizontal plane one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which in the plan on file in the clerk's office coincides with the perimeter of the horizontal zone.
Larger than utility runway means a runway that is constructed for and intended to be used by propeller driven aircraft of greater than twelve thousand five hundred (12,500) pounds maximum gross weight and jet powered aircraft.
Nonconforming use means any preexisting structure, object of natural growth, or use of land which is inconsistent with the provisions of this article or an amendment thereto.
Nonprecision instrument runway means a runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities with only horizontal guidance, or area type navigation equipment, for which a straight-in nonprecision instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned.
Obstruction means any structure, growth or other object, including a mobile object, which exceeds a limiting height set forth in section 3-14.
Person means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association, joint stock association, or governmental entity; includes a trustee, a receiver, an assignee, or a similar representative of any of them.
Precision instrument runway means a runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing an Instrument Landing System (ILS) or a Precision Approach Radar (PAR). It also means a runway for which a precision approach system is planned and is so indicated on an approved airport layout plan or any other planning document.
Primary surface means a surface longitudinally centered on a runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of that runway; for military runways or when the runway has no specially prepared surface, or planned hard surface, the primary surface ends at each end of that runway. The width of the primary surface is set forth in section 3-13. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline.
Runway means a defined area on an airport prepared for landing and take-off of aircraft along its length.
Structure means an object, including a mobile object, constructed or installed by man, including but without limitation, buildings, towers, cranes, smokestacks, earth formation, and overhead transmission lines.
Transitional surfaces means surfaces that extend outward at ninety (90) degree angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision approach surfaces, which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at ninety (90) degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
Tree means any object of natural growth.
Utility runway means a runway that is constructed for and intended to be used by propeller driven aircraft of twelve thousand five hundred (12,500) pounds maximum gross weight and less.
Visual runway means a runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using visual approach procedures.

In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and conical surfaces as they apply to the airport. Such zones are shown on the airport zoning map prepared by VTN Louisiana, Inc., and dated December 15, 1979, which is on file in the clerk's office and made a part hereof. An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
(1)
Utility runway visual approach zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two hundred fifty (250) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(2)
Utility runway nonprecision instrument approach zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is five hundred (500) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of two thousand (2,000) feet at a horizontal distance five thousand (5,000) feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(3)
Runway larger than utility visual approach zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is five hundred (500) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(4)
Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than three-quarter (¾) mile nonprecision instrument approach zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is five hundred (500) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of three thousand five hundred (3,500) feet at a horizontal distance often thousand (10,000) feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(5)
Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as three-quarter (¾) mile nonprecision instrument approach zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is one thousand (1,000) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of four thousand (4,000) feet at a horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(6)
Precision instrument runway approach zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is one thousand (1,000) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet at a horizontal distance of fifty thousand (50,000) feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(7)
Transitional zones: The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces.
(8)
Horizontal zone: The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of ten thousand (10,000) feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.

(a)
Future uses. Except as specifically provided in subsections (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3), no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (d).
(1)
In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
(2)
In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground; except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
(3)
In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this article except as set forth in section 3-14(b).
(b)
Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on May 2, 1981 or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made; Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
(c)
Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the director of aviation determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
(d)
Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the aviation board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the federal aviation administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the aviation board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the director of aviation for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the director of aviation does not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny the application.
(e)
Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the aviation board of adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the New Orleans Aviation Board at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary-markings and lights.
