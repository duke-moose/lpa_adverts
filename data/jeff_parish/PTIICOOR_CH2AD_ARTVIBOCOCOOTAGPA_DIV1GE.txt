(b)
Definition. As used in this section, the word "board" shall be interpreted to mean any board, commission, committee or authority created by the parish council either by ordinance or resolution.
(c)
Standards for creation. All boards established by the council shall be established by either ordinance or resolution. A resolution shall be used where the board is to be advisory in nature and does not have authority to implement its recommendation without further action of the council. An ordinance shall be used when the board is to have independent authority to carry out policies and objectives and establish procedures without the express ratification of the council. An ordinance shall also be used where it is otherwise legally required or advisable.
(d)
Length of existence. All boards hereafter established will cease to exist twelve (12) months after their establishment if established by resolution or forty-eight (48) months if established by ordinance, provided that the council, in the ordinance or resolution creating a board may specify a lesser or greater period for the life of the board. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if a board remains active beyond what would otherwise be the expiration date of that board and the resolution or ordinance creating the board did not specify a lesser or greater period for the life of the board, then that board shall exist until the date of last action by the board or until the council specifically terminates the board, whichever occurs first. Council termination shall occur by resolution if the board were created by resolution or by ordinance if the board were created by ordinance.
(e)
Designation of chairperson(s). The ordinance and resolution establishing a board shall indicate the party or parties who will serve as chairperson(s). As an exception to this requirement, a board may be empowered to elect its own chairperson(s) in the ordinance or resolution establishing the board.
(f)
Designation of office of primary responsibility. Each ordinance or resolution establishing a board shall indicate the parish office, department or agency which shall serve as the focal point for inquiries or actions concerning the board.
(g)
Terms of office. Each ordinance or resolution establishing a board shall set forth the term of office of the various members. The length of the term shall be consistent with the purpose of the board and the other provisions of this section. If a member is appointed to fill a vacancy, this member shall serve until the expiration of term for which the vacated member was appointed. The council may in the ordinance or resolution establishing a board, establish other provisions as to terms or the filling of vacancies. However, if the board is terminated, either pursuant to provisions of subsection (d) or other action, the membership of the board shall be automatically terminated.
(h)
Approval of membership. All members of all boards created by the parish council shall be subject to the approval of the parish council and the terms of the members shall end at the expiration of the term of the council which appointed the membership, provided that the ordinance or resolution establishing the board may specify otherwise as relates to the approval of membership and terms of office. However, nothing herein shall affect the authority of a council to reconstitute any board with new membership during the council's term of office.
(i)
Exception. This section shall not apply to any boards, committees, commissions and authorities to which the council merely appoints members or representatives.
