g.

h.

j.

k.

l.
The float or truck parade organization receives two (2) suspensions within a five-year period; or

(2)
A revocation of a float or truck parade organization's permit eliminates that organization's ability to receive a permit under section 6-75(a) or 6-75(e) respectively. Should the number of parades fall below the maximum number of parades allowable under section 6-75 then said organization may apply for a permit; however, its status is equal to any other new float parade organization that wishes to apply. The issuance of this permit will be governed by section 6-75(b).
(b)
Class II violations (intermediate violations):
(1)
The following violations are declared to be Class II violations:
a.
The float parade organization parade violates the provisions of section 6-82 entitled "floats"; or
b.
The float parade organization parades with less than the number of marching bands required by section 6-80 entitled "bands" with each marching band below the requisite number to be considered a separate violation; or
c.
The float parade organization parades with more than the number of horse groups as set forth in section 6-84 entitled "horses and mules"; or
d.

(3)
For all Class II violations, the director of citizens' affairs shall issue a written notice to the float or truck parade organization of the violation(s). If the violation is not corrected the following year and/or there is another Class II violation by said float or truck parade organization the following year, the float or truck parade organization will have its permit suspended for one (1) year.
