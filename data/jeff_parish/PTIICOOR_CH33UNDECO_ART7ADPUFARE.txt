(1)
The property owner shall grant adequate utility servitudes for all public and private utilities as required by the public works director or private utility provider. Minimum servitude widths shall be a total of twenty (20) feet alongside or rear property lines for water and sewer utilities, which may straddle a property line. Utility servitudes shall be shown on the plat and dedicated in conjunction with recordation of the Plat.
(2)
Servitudes shall be dedicated outside and along street rights-of-way as determined by the public works director or private utility provider to be necessary for utilities and storm sewers. Unless otherwise authorized or required by the public works director, utilities within or adjacent to street rights-of-way shall be scheduled consistent with the Jefferson Parish Subdivision Public Improvements Standards Manual.
(3)
Wherever practical, servitudes shall be located along lot lines. No buildings or structures, except as necessary for utilities, shall be permitted within or on servitudes. Fences or walls may be constructed in public servitudes, except rights-of-way, at the risk of the property owner. The parish bears no responsibility for replacement of structures damaged through authorized activities within a servitude.
(4)
The applicant shall provide adequate on-site rights-of-way for anticipated traffic demands in a manner consistent with this UDC, the comprehensive plan and project specific traffic impact analysis ("TIA"), if applicable. If a TIA shows that a proposed development creates the need for additional off-site right-of-way, the applicant shall be required to provide or fund acquisition of required right-of-way prior to development approval. Funding for off-site improvements shall be limited to the developer's proportional share of the costs that are attributable to demands projected to be generated by the proposed development.
(5)
Whenever any canal is located in a proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall provide a thirty-five (35) feet servitude from the top of the bank of each side of the canal and a fifteen (15) feet servitude from the top of the bank along each side of the ditch for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, improving, maintaining or protecting the canal or ditch, and such servitude shall be dedicated to the Parish or other appropriate public agency.
(6)
Whenever any subsurface drain line is located in a proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall provide a servitude equal to the total of half the diameter of the pipe plus ten (10) feet on each side of the center line of the drain line for the purpose of maintenance or improvement.

(a)
Purpose. The purpose of regulating the amount and nature of vehicular access points is to balance the need for providing access to individual private properties with the need to preserve an adequate level of capacity on the streets providing access. Vehicular access restrictions may be required to be shown on subdivision plats.
(b)
Access to arterials. Where a residential subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial, the Parish may require that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
(1)
Lots shall back onto the arterial and front onto a parallel collector or local street; no access shall be provided from the arterial; or
(2)
A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to the arterial; or
(3)
A marginal access or service road separated from the arterial by a ten (10) feet wide planting strip and having access at suitable points.
(4)
Secondary access. For public safety and convenience, secondary access shall be provided for any single family residential development with thirty (30) or more homes, or any other development projected to generate more than three-hundred (300) trips per day, or any development that derives its sole access from a street projected to carry more than three-hundred (300) trips per day.
(c)
Railroads, interstates or major arterials. Railroad rights-of-way, interstates, and major arterials, where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows:
(1)
In residential zoning districts, buffers shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way, interstate or major arterial. Buffers shall measure at least fifty (50) feet in width and shall include at least one tree every thirty-five (35) feet and a combination of fencing, walls, berms and/or landscaping necessary to establish a six (6) feet tall opaque buffer within two (2) years of plat approval. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat.
(2)
In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses, wherever practicable, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad right-of-way shall be at a sufficient distance from the railroad right-of-way to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
(3)
When streets parallel to the railroad right-of-way intersect a street that crosses the railroad right-of-way at grade, they shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least one-hundred fifty (150) feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
(d)
Driveway permits. A driveway permit, issued by the inspection and code enforcement director shall be required for all single family residences and any multiple family development encompassing five (5) or more dwelling units. Driveway permits for all other uses shall be obtained from the public works director prior to the construction of any new access point. When a traffic study is required, no driveway permit will be issued until the traffic study process has been completed. For the purposes of evaluating driveway permit requests, the boundary of the site is considered to be all contiguous parcels under the same ownership on the date of adoption of this provision. Any non-residential change in use resulting in the following will require a new driveway permit:
(1)
An increase of greater than fifty (50) peak hour trips, or
(2)
A ten (10) percent increase in average daily trips of an existing non-residential or multi-family development, or
(3)
Over ten (10) additional daily vehicle trips made by vehicles exceeding thirty-thousand (30,000) pounds gross vehicle weight.
(e)
Driveway design standards:
(1)
Dimensions. Unless required for emergency access, the minimum driveway width shall be twelve (12) feet for residential and fifteen (15) feet for non-residential land uses, and the maximum driveway width shall be twenty-five (25) feet for residential and thirty-five (35) feet for non-residential land uses. The minimum thickness shall comply with adopted improvement standards.
(2)
Approach. The driveways adjacent to paved roads shall provide a concrete driveway approach from the property line to the roadbed edge.
(f)
Substandard access. Where access standards or design objectives of this UDC cannot be met, the public works director shall be guided by the following process in determining whether substandard access may be permitted.
(1)
The public works director shall first determine whether alternate access to another street exists that meets the standards of the Code.
(2)
Where alternate access opportunities are determined not to exist, the public works director may grant a reduction in spacing standards of up to twenty (20) percent.
(3)
If after considering alternatives subject to subsections (a) and (b) above, the public works director determines that no feasible alternatives exist, a substandard access permit may be granted as a subdivision waiver subject to the following findings:
a.
Conditions or circumstances exist which limit the strict application of the requirements of this UDC, including the lack of a secondary access to another public street, the inability to use joint access, and the lack of engineering or construction solutions that can be applied to mitigate the condition;
b.
The proposed access will not result in undue delay or congestion or be detrimental to the safety of motoring public using the roadway; and
c.
The limiting access will create an exceptional and undue hardship on the applicant and that the permit issued will allow a reasonable use of the property.

The intent of this Section is to provide the information necessary to allow decision-makers to assess the transportation implications of traffic associated with a proposed development, to address the transportation-related issues associated with development proposals that may be of concern to neighboring residents, business owners and property owners, and to provide a basis for negotiation regarding improvements and funding participation in conjunction with an application for development. This Section establishes requirements for the TIA and evaluation of transportation impacts associated with proposed developments.
(1)
Purpose. A traffic impact analysis ("TIA") will be required for certain permitted and special permitted uses, major subdivisions and site plans exceeding specific trip generation thresholds. The purpose of a traffic impact analysis will be to:
a.
Evaluate traffic operations and impacts at site access points under projected peak period traffic loads;
b.
Evaluate the impact of site-generated traffic on affected intersections in the vicinity of the development site;
c.
Evaluate the impact of site-generated traffic on the quality of traffic flow within a reasonable distance of the site of development;
d.
Evaluate the impact of the proposed development on neighborhood collector or local streets in the vicinity of the site;
e.
Ensure that site access and other improvements needed to mitigate the traffic impact of the development meet commonly accepted engineering design standards;
f.
Ensure that adequate facilities for pedestrians, transit users and bicyclists have been provided;
g.
Identify transportation infrastructure needs and related costs created by the development and cost sharing on needed improvements.
(2)
Applicability. Traffic impact analysis shall be required for any amendments to the official zoning map or future land use map, subdivision review, special permitted use, or site plan under the following described conditions; or as otherwise required in the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances:
a.
The proposed use will generate seven-hundred fifty (750) or more average daily trips, according to most current versions of the Institute of Transportation Engineers ("ITE") Trip Generation Informational Report or comparable research data published by a public agency or institution; or
b.
The proposed development will concentrate one-thousand five-hundred (1,500) or more trips per day through a single access point; or
c.
The proposed development will include thirty (30) or more dwelling units taking sole access from an existing or planned neighborhood collector or local street; or
d.
The proposed development will include a drive-through facility or structural parking lot entrance that will result in traffic spillover onto a public street, when eight (8) or more vehicles are queued at the facility; or
e.
Any residential project accessing an arterial street; or
f.
Any development that is subject to a state requirement for a traffic impact study. [8-31-2011]
(3)
Waiver. The requirements of this section for a TIA may be waived by the planning director, public works director and parish traffic engineer when it is determined that such report is not necessary to determine needed road improvements or that no unsafe or hazardous conditions will be created by the development as proposed.
(4)
Preparation. The TIA shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer or AICP certified planner with qualifications and no less than five (5) year's experience in the preparation of traffic analyses.
(5)
Traffic service standards. The standards for traffic service that shall be used to evaluate the findings of traffic impact studies are:
a.
Level of service. For collector or local streets, a level of service ("LOS") "C" or better shall be maintained. On any arterial or higher order street a LOS "D" or better shall be maintained. Where the existing LOS is below these standards, the TIA shall identify those improvements required to ensure that development related traffic demands result in no net reduction in LOS, and identify additional improvements needed to raise the level of service to the standards on the arterial or higher order street to the adopted LOS standard.
b.
Number of access points. The spacing of access points shall comply with applicable parish, state and American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ("AASHTO") standards.
c.
Neighborhood collector or local street impact. Average daily traffic ("ADT") on neighborhood collector or local streets shall be within the ranges spelled out in the thoroughfare plan for the class of street involved. No non-residential development shall increase the traffic on a neighborhood collector or local street with at least three-hundred (300) average daily trips by more than twenty-five (25) percent.
d.
Internal circulation. On-site vehicle circulation and parking patterns shall be designed so as not to interfere with the flow of traffic on any public street and shall accommodate all anticipated types of site traffic.
e.
Safety. Access points shall be designed to provide for adequate sight distance and appropriate facilities to accommodate acceleration and deceleration of site traffic.
f.
Curb space use plan. Details shall be provided on curb space use on public streets along the edge of the development site when it is intended that such areas be used for parking, parking space access, delivery and loading zones, passenger zones, taxi cab stands, bus stops, fire zones and/or other official/emergency zones. This review shall include a description of existing conditions prior to development, and proposed changes resulting from the development, including a description of any loss or gain in curb space use by the activities intended.
(6)
Contents. A TIA shall contain information addressing the factors listed below.
a.
Site description. The TIA shall contain illustrations and narrative that describe the characteristics of the site and adjacent land uses as well as expected development in the vicinity which will influence future traffic conditions. A description of the proposed development including access plans, staging plans and an indication of land use and intensity, shall be provided.
b.
Study area. The TIA shall identify the geographic area under study and identify the roadway segments, critical intersections and access points to be analyzed. The study shall include all intersections and access points to the development and with all arterial and collector streets and/or all arterial and collector street intersections located on the approaches within one-half (1/2) mile of the site. If no arterial street intersection is so located, the study area may be extended to the nearest arterial street intersection if the proposed development is projected to contribute at least five (5) percent of the traffic at that intersection at the time of development, unless determined otherwise by the planning director and parish traffic engineer.
c.
Existing traffic conditions. The TIA shall contain a summary of the data used in the analysis of existing traffic conditions, including:
1.
Traffic count and turning movement information, including the source of and date when traffic count information was collected;
2.
Correction factors that were used to convert collected traffic data into representative design hour traffic volumes;
3.
Roadway characteristics, including the design configuration of existing or proposed roadways, existing traffic control measures (speed limits, traffic signals, etc.) and existing driveways and turning movement conflicts in the vicinity of the site; and
4.
The existing LOS for roadways and intersections without project development traffic using methods documented in the Special Report 209: Highway Capacity Manual or latest edition, published by the Transportation Research Board, or comparable accepted methods of evaluation. LOS shall be calculated for the weekday peak hour and, in the case of uses generating high levels of weekend traffic, the Saturday or Sunday peak hour as determined by the parish traffic engineer or planning director.
d.
Horizon year(s) and background traffic growth. The report shall identify the horizon year(s) that were analyzed in the study, the background traffic growth factors for each horizon year, and the method and assumptions used to develop the background traffic growth. Unless otherwise approved by the parish traffic engineer or planning director, the impact of development shall be analyzed for the year after the development is expected to be at full occupancy.
e.
Traffic assignment. The report shall identify projected design hour traffic volumes for roadway segments, intersections or driveways in the study area, with and without the proposed development, for the horizon year(s) of the study, including:
1.
Traffic count and turning movement information;
2.
Correction factors that were used to convert collected traffic data into representative design hour traffic volumes;
3.
Roadway characteristics, including the design configuration of existing or proposed roadways, existing and proposed traffic control measures (speed limits, traffic signals, etc.) and existing and proposed driveways and turning movement conflicts in the vicinity of the site; and
4.
The existing and proposed LOS for roadways and intersections without project development traffic using methods documented in the Special Report 209: Highway Capacity Manual or latest edition, published by the Transportation Research Board, or comparable accepted methods of evaluation. LOS shall be calculated for the weekday peak hour and, in the case of uses generating high levels of weekend traffic, the Saturday or Sunday peak hour as determined by the parish traffic engineer or planning director.
f.
Mitigation/alternatives. In situations where the traffic level of service standards are exceeded, the report shall evaluate each of the following alternatives for achieving the traffic service standards:
1.
Identify where additional right-of-way is needed to implement mitigation strategies;
2.
Identify suggested phasing of street or intersection improvements where needed to maintain compliance with traffic service standards; and
3.
Identify the anticipated cost of recommended improvements.
(7)
Process for the review and preparation of a TIA. The following steps provide an outline of the steps to be included in the preparation and review of a TIA:
a.
The public works director, parish traffic engineer and planning director shall be consulted for assistance in determining whether a traffic impact study needs to be prepared for a proposed development application;
b.
The public works director, parish traffic engineer and planning director shall meet with applicants to identify study issues, assumptions, horizon years and time periods to be analyzed, analysis procedures, available sources of data, past and related studies, report requirements and other topics relevant to study requirements. The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development ("LDOTD") District 02 Traffic Engineer or designated representative shall be contacted and coordinates with as appropriate when the TIA includes state or federal highways as points of access for a development;
c.
Following initial completion of a traffic impact analysis, the TIA shall be submitted to the planning director for distribution to the staff of all jurisdictions involved in the construction and maintenance of public roadways serving the development;
d.
Within ten (10) working days, staff shall complete an initial review to determine the completeness of the TIA and shall provide a written summary to the applicant outlining the need for any supplemental study or analysis to adequately address any deficiencies. A meeting to discuss the contents and findings of the TIA and the need for additional study may be requested by the applicant;
e.
Following a determination that the technical analysis is complete, staff shall prepare a report outlining recommendations that have been developed to address the findings and conclusions included in the study regarding the proposed development's access needs and impacts on the transportation system. Depending on the type of application, the recommendations may be presented to the PAB and/or Parish Council.
f.
In the case of a traffic impact analysis showing deficiencies requiring mitigation within the public right-of-way, negotiations based on the conclusions and findings resulting from the traffic study shall be held with the public works director, parish traffic engineer, planning director and parish attorney. A development agreement, detailing the applicant's responsibilities and the parish's responsibilities for implementing identified mitigation measures, shall be prepared following the negotiations for final action by parish council and the applicant.
(8)
Report findings. If staff finds that the proposed development will not meet applicable service level standards, staff shall recommend one or more of the following actions by the public or the applicant:
a.
Reduce the size, scale, scope or density of the development to reduce traffic generation;
b.
Divide the project into phases and authorize only one (1) phase at a time until traffic capacity is adequate for the next phase of development;
c.
Dedicate right-of-way for street improvements;
d.
