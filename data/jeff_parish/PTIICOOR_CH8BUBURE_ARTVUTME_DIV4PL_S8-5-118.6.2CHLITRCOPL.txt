In the event a licensed trade contractor, (contractor of record such as electrical, mechanical, gas, or plumbing) is discharged, replaced by the general contractor (if any) or property owner, or abandons any job for any reason, written notarized notification shall immediately be given to the appropriate section of the department of inspection and code enforcement.
The notification shall inform the parish of the last date said trades contractor was affiliated with or responsible for the job. Such notification shall also include the name, address, and parish license number of the new trades contractor (contractor of record). In the event the notification does not name a new licensed trades contractor or if a new trades contractor has not yet been selected or if, a named new trades contractor's license is not valid, no further work shall be performed on the permitted construction. All work shall cease until such time as this is rectified by the provision of a properly Jefferson Parish Licensed Trades Contractor.
No application for inspection (filing) shall be accepted nor shall any inspection be scheduled until the new, properly Licensed Trades Contractor has paid a "take over fee" of fifty dollars ($50.00) and a non-refundable application fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00), a total of sixty-five dollars ($65.00) through the appropriate section of the department of inspection and code enforcement (see section 8-2-104, Fees). When all applicable fees have been paid and proper license is provided the appropriate section shall make the necessary adjustments to the department's records and the trades work may be reconvened.
