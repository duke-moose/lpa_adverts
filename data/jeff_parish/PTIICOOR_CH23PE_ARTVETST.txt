(b)
Investigation and hearing. The inspector general shall undertake confidential investigations of any complaint prior to proceeding with filing a formal charge, if any, against the respondent.

(2)
For purposes of an investigation or a hearing, the commission may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence and require the production of any records which the commission deems relevant or material to the investigation or hearing.

a.
All parties or their counsel may comply with the Louisiana Administrative Code's provisions for issuance of discovery unless this section specifies otherwise.

(5)
No disciplinary action shall be taken against a public employee, elected official or person by the commission unless it is determined by a majority vote of its membership that such elected official or person has violated a provision of this division within its jurisdiction at a public hearing conducted for that purpose.

If the violation in question does incur criminal penalties, the inspector general shall bear the burden of proving such violation beyond a reasonable doubt.
(8)
Any witness other than the person who is the subject of the investigation or hearing may be accompanied by counsel at investigations or hearings, which counsel may advise the witness of his rights, subject to reasonable limitations to prevent obstruction of or interference with the orderly conduct of the investigation or hearing. His counsel may also submit proposed questions to be asked for his client.
(9)
Any witness at any investigation or hearing, subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the commission, shall be entitled to a copy of his testimony when the same becomes important and relevant in a criminal proceeding or subsequent investigation or hearing provided that the furnishing of such copy will not prejudice the public safety or security.

No party, attorney, or individual shall provide evidence to the commission that is not made part of the hearing record.
(11)
If the investigation of the commission fails to disclose any substantial evidence to support the charges and after a review of the inspector general's investigation, if one is conducted, the commission shall make an official determination of its findings and thereupon close its file on the charges. At the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall issue a report concerning its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations relating thereto within seven (7) days of the conclusion of the hearing. The report shall be sent to all parties and their counsel via certified mail.
(12)
The prosecuting counsel and the respondent may, prior to the hearing before the commission, enter into a written stipulation or consent agreement to resolve the charges against the respondent.

Privacy, safety and security requests.
a.
Any person required to file a financial disclosure statement as required by this division may, at the time the financial disclosure statement is filed or at any time thereafter, except at any time after a request for inspection of the statement has been filed with the parish attorney, submit a request to the parish attorney to withhold from public inspection any item or items disclosed therein on the grounds that disclosure of the item or items would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the person required to file or would cause a risk to the safety or security to the person required to file or to any other person.
b.
The parish attorney shall evaluate each such request, and shall consider the following factors in such evaluation:
1.
whether the item is privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure by any applicable law or judicial precedent;
2.
whether the item is of a highly personal nature;

e.
Regardless of whether or not a person required to file has submitted a request to the parish attorney to withhold from public inspection any item or items in said person's financial disclosure statement, the parish attorney may, upon his or her own initiative withhold any item items in the statement from public disclosure or inspection if the parish attorney finds that such disclosure or inspection would constitute a risk to the safety or security of the person required to file.
f.
