The provisions embraced within this subdivision shall constitute and shall be known as and may be cited as the "Minimum Housing Standards."
It is found and declared that there exist in the unincorporated areas of the Parish of Jefferson certain substandard and unsanitary residential building and dwelling units characterized by physical conditions which render them unfit and unsafe for human habitation. These conditions are of such nature as to be detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the occupants thereof as well as the public at large.
It is further found and declared that there exist in the unincorporated areas of the Parish of Jefferson residential buildings and dwelling units which were originally constructed according to standards now recognized to be obsolete and deficient in terms of current modern housing standards governing construction, use, occupancy, light, ventilation, safety and sanitary facilities. The continued existence of these obsolete and deficient residential building and dwelling units is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the occupants thereof and the public at large.
It is further found that the existence of such substandard, unsanitary, obsolete, and deficient buildings used for dwelling purposes threatens the physical and economic stability of the surrounding residential buildings and neighborhood facilities, occasions disproportionate expenditure of public funds for remedial action, and jeopardizes the well-being of the entire community.
Therefore, it is in the public interest of the citizens of the unincorporated areas of Jefferson Parish to protect and promote decent, safe, and sanitary residential building and dwelling units by the adoption and enforcement of the minimum housing standards of this subdivision.
The adoption and enforcement of this Minimum Housing Standards is hereby declared to be a necessary municipal governmental function in the interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the unincorporated areas of Jefferson Parish.

If, after the above required notice and hearing, the director of the department of inspection and code enforcement determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit under consideration is in one (1) of the two (2) conditions listed below, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of that determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order requiring him, to the extent and within the time specified in the order, to take the steps outlined below or to suffer the penalties indicated:
(1)
If the determination is that the dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, the order shall require the dwelling or dwelling unit vacated and closed as a place for human habitation. Such order shall be served on the owner of his agent and on each tenant, and if the order is not complied with within the time specified therein, the director shall notify the sheriff's department of the violation of the order, and the sheriff's department shall enforce the order by evicting the occupants of such dwellings or dwelling unit. The director shall cause to be placed on the main entrance of every such dwelling or dwelling unit ordered vacated and closed a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and unlawful." Any person who rents, leases or permits the occupancy of such a dwelling or dwelling unit declared unfit for human occupancy shall upon conviction be fined not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than ninety (90) days, or both, in the discretion of the court, and each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.
(A)
The designation of dwellings or dwelling units as unfit for human habitation and the procedure for the condemnation and placarding of such unfit dwellings or dwelling units shall be carried out in compliance with the following requirements:
Any dwelling or dwelling unit which shall be found to have any of the following defects shall be condemned as unfit for human habitation and declared to be a nuisance and shall be so designated and placarded by the director.
(a)
One which is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, unsanitary, unsafe, or vermin-infested that it creates a serious hazard to the health or safety of the occupants or of the public.
(b)
One which lacks illumination, ventilation, or sanitation facilities adequate to protect the health or safety of the occupants or of the public.
(B)
Whenever the director has declared a dwelling or multi-family dwelling as unfit for human habitation and constituting a nuisance, he shall give notice to the owner of such declaration and placarding of the dwelling or multi-family dwelling as unfit for human habitation. Such notice shall:
(a)
Be in writing;
(b)
Include a legal description of the real estate sufficient for identification;
(c)
State the time by which occupants must vacate the dwelling units;
(d)
Said notice shall further state that if such repairs, reconstruction, alterations, removal, or demolition are not voluntarily completed within the stated time as set forth in the notice, the director shall institute such legal proceedings charging the person or persons, firm, corporation or agent with a violation of this Code.
Service of notice to vacate shall be as follows:
(a)
By delivery to the owner personally, or by leaving the notice at the usual place of abode of the owner with a person of suitable age and discretion; or
(b)
By depositing the notice in the United States Post Office addressed to the owner at his last known address with postage prepaid thereon; or
(c)
By posting and keeping posted for twenty-four (24) hours a copy of the notice in the placard form in a conspicuous place on the premises to be vacated.
(C)
Any dwelling or dwelling unit condemned as unfit for human habitation, and so designated and placarded by the director, shall be vacated within thirty (30) days after notice of such condemnation has been given by the director to the owner and/or occupant of the building.
No dwelling or dwelling unit which has been condemned and placarded as unit for human habitation shall again be used for human habitation until approval is secured from the director and such placard is removed. The director shall remove such placard whenever the defect or defects upon which the condemnation and placarding action were based have been eliminated.
No person shall deface or remove the placard from any dwelling or dwelling unit which has been condemned as unfit for human habitation and placarded as such, except as provided herein. Anyone who removed or defaces such placard shall upon conviction be fined not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than fifty dollars ($50.00) or imprisoned not more than thirty (30) days, or both, at the discretion of the court.
The director may, within the limits of his own discretion refer the violations to the court of proper jurisdiction for application of the procedure as outlined in section 8-2-102.5, Unsafe Buildings of the Building Code adopted by Jefferson Parish.
(2)
If the determination is that the dwelling or dwelling unit, though not unfit for human habitation, does violate certain of the minimum housing standards of this Subdivision, the order shall require the owner to repair, alter, or improve the dwelling or dwelling unit. If the owner fails to comply with such an order, he shall, upon conviction, be fined for each violation not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than fifty dollars ($50.00) or imprisoned not more than thirty (30) days, or both, in the discretion of the court, and each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense. Service of notice shall be as outlined in section 8-3-110.1.12(1) hereof.
