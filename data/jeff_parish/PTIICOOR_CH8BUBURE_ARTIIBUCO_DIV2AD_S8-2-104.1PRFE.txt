A building permit shall not be issued nor application for inspection (filing) accepted until the fees prescribed in section 104 have been paid. No amendment to a building permit or application (filing) shall be released until the additional fee, if any, is due because of an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, or service systems has been paid.
