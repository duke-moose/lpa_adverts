(a)
Jefferson Parish adopts the statewide "DOTD Average Salary Rate" document to regulate maximum direct and payable hourly wage rates, overhead rates (average and field), and multiplier, for use in paying for professional services. The criteria for the establishment of maximum payable hourly rates is based on the firm's actual rates for salary and overhead, subject to a ceiling/cap equal to the rates shown on the Statewide "DOTD Average Salary Rate" document (average rate plus one (1) standard deviation) multiplied by a factor not-to-exceed 1.15 to include profit. Attachment "A" to the Standard Engineering Agreement is amended in accordance with the provisions herein established.
(1)
The "DOTD Average Salary Rate" document is to be used for establishing maximum direct and payable hourly rates, maximum overhead rate and multiplier, for each new contract using the then current official publication by DOTD.
(2)
If a personnel classification is required for a parish project, but is not included in the Statewide "DOTD Average Salary Rate" document, the parish administration shall establish a new personnel classification and an appropriate, noninflated, maximum direct and payable hourly rate, which is consistent with personnel categories of similar expertise found within the Statewide "DOTD Average Salary Rate" document, and include it in Attachment "A".
(3)
Attachment "A" to the Standard Professional Services Agreement for Jefferson Parish shall be amended to incorporate the following language:
a.
This attachment shall be part of all professional service agreements for engineering and architectural services in Jefferson Parish,
b.
The engineer shall be reimbursed for costs incurred by sub-consultants at the rate of 1.10 times the actual invoices of sub-consultants up to a total amount of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00). Thereafter, the rate shall be reduced to 1.05, and
c.
That once contract fees are negotiated using Statewide "DOTD Average Salary Rates" in effect at the time of negotiation, those fees will be unaffected by subsequent versions of the Statewide "DOTD Average Salary Rate" document. The rates in effect for this contract are shown in Attachment "A" to this contract.
(4)
The most current version of the Statewide "DOTD Average Salary Rate" document in effect after the effective date of this resolution shall apply to hourly rate services included in contracts and amendments negotiated after the effective date of this section.
(b)
Hourly and overhead rates in program management contracts for the Drainage Capital Improvement Program, SELA Program, Road Bond Program, Sewerage Capital Improvement Program, West Napoleon Road Improvement Program, and Causeway Boulevard Improvement Program shall be changed to reflect actual hourly rates paid by the consultants to employees on April 1, 2002 and shall be adjusted at a rate not to exceed five (5) percent per year, providing that in no case may the rates exceed the version of Attachment "A" then in effect and further providing that the consultants submit audited overhead rates on an annual basis throughout the life of the contract.
(c)
Engineering fees for design services contracts, including lump sum amounts and not-to-exceed amounts connected with hourly rate services, in contracts, and amendments thereto, existing at the time the provisions of this article become effective, shall remain unchanged.
(d)
The criteria for the establishment of maximum direct and payable hourly and overhead rates for firms incorporated out-of-state shall be the same as those for firms incorporated in-state.
(e)
On all contracts for which the council has selected two (2) or more consultants to share the work, the council shall specify the prime, or lead, consultant, and this consultant shall perform a larger percentage of the basic design services than any of the subconsultants, but in no case shall the prime, or lead consultant perform less than forty (40) percent of the basic design services.
(f)
Hourly and overhead rates in program management contracts for the roadway, pedestrian/bike path and bridge improvement program and the new sewerage improvement program shall be based on the statewide "DOTD Average Salary Rates" in effect at the time of negotiation in accordance with the version of Attachment "A" then in effect. The rates may be updated throughout the life of the program to reflect updated "DOTD Average Salary Rates" at the discretion of the director of the department of public works, engineering, or capital projects.
