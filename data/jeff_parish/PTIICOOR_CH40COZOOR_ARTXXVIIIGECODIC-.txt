This district is composed of certain land and structures used to provide for the retailing of goods and the furnishing of major services. This district characteristically occupies a larger area than the neighborhood commercial district since it is intended to serve a greater population and to offer a wider range of services. Full and complete development of all property in this district is of importance in order for the district to effectively serve its economic function. These districts are in general located along major thoroughfares and future expansion should desirably occur as an increase in depth of the district rather than further strip-like extension along the thoroughfares.

No building permits shall be issued for site plans that have been declared null and void. Nevertheless, such site plans may be submitted as a new application for review, and must conform to all site plan and review requirements in effect at the time of the later application.
