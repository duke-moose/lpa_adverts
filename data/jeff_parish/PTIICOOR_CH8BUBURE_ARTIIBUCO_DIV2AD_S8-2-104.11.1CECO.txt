Upon satisfactory completion of permitted construction of a building (or structure) and installation of the required service systems, in accordance with the adopted codes, reviewed plans and specifications, and after all final inspections are satisfactory; the code official shall issue a certificate of completion.
The certificate of completion shall state the nature of the use(s) permitted and shall authorize the connection to utility service systems. No building shall be lawfully occupied until the appropriate certificate of completion has been issued by the code official.
The code official retains right of entry to the premises until the appropriate certificate of completion has been issued. However, the certificate of completion does not grant authority to occupy or connect the service systems of a commercial building permitted as a "shell only" building. For the purposes of this section the term "shell only" shall mean a commercial building with a structural foundation, enclosing walls and a roof but containing no electrical, mechanical, or above grade plumbing service systems.
