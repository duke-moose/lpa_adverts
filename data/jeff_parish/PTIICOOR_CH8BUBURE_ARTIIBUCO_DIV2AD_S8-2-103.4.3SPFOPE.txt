When complete application for permit to erect or enlarge a building has been filed and pending issuance of such permit, the code official may, at his discretion, issue special permission for the foundation only. The holder of such permission is proceeding at his own risk and without assurance that a permit for the remainder of the work will be granted and without assurance corrections will not be required in order to meet provisions of the technical codes. All losses or delay incurred as a result of proceeding prior to completion of the permit process will be borne by owner/contractor.
The Parish of Jefferson does not assume liability in either tort or contract where subsequent to the issuance of this special foundation permission, the code official determines that a building permit to erect or enlarge a building should not be issued. Under no circumstance does such special foundation permission relieve the permitted party of the obligation to have the foundation and sub-grade utilities inspected by the parish prior to pouring the foundation.
For all new construction, proper elevation must be certified to the code official before the required foundation inspections can be scheduled. This special foundation permission shall not be granted for one- and two-family dwellings or their attendant utility buildings. In extreme cases where future access to such utility buildings will be severely limited the code official may grant an exception.
