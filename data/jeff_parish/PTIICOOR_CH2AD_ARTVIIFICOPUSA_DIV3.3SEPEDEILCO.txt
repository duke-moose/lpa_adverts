(a)
The specialized review committee shall identify specific technical elements of the project, depending on the characteristics of the project, to be included in the technical score. Each member of the specialized review committee shall make his scoring of assigned elements available for public review. Such scores shall be considered public record.
(b)
An adjusted score approach shall be used by the parish in determining the winning proposal. An adjusted score shall be determined using the following components:
(1)
The technical score determined by the specialized review committee as follows: Weighing factors may be assigned to each element depending on its relative magnitude or significance to the overall project. Each committee member shall rate his assigned element of the proposal from each of the entities on the short list and shall submit such scores to the chairman of the specialized review committee. The schedule and price bid shall not be made known to the committee members during the scoring process. The chairman of the committee shall adjust the scores for any applicable weighing factors and shall determine the total technical score for each proposal.
(2)
The time value, consisting of the product of the proposed contract time expressed in calendar days multiplied by the value-per-calendar-day expressed in dollars established by the department and included in the "scope of services package."
(3)
The price proposal.
(4)
The adjusted score for each entity's design-build proposal shall be determined by the following formula: adjusted score = (price bid + time value) divided by technical score. If the time value is not used, the adjusted score shall be determined by the following formula: adjusted score = price bid divided by technical score.
(5)
Prior to determining the adjusted score, the chairman shall notify each design-build proposer, in writing, of each proposer's final total technical score. A proposer may request, in writing, a review of its final total technical score by the chairman or his designated representative. If any proposer requests a review of its total technical score, the chairman shall hold a hearing to review such within a reasonable time after the request has been received by the chairman. The chairman shall give the requesting proposer reasonable notice of the time and place of such hearing. The requesting proposer may appear at the hearing and present facts and arguments in support of the request for review of its final total technical score.
(c)
The chairman shall present his findings from the hearing to the parish council. The council shall determine what action shall be taken regarding the proposer's request to review its final total technical score. Except as provided for in section 2-935.15(b), the council's decision shall be final and not subject to appeal by any legal process.
