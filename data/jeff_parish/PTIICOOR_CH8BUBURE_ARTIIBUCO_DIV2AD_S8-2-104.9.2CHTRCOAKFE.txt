In the event of a change in licensed plumbing contractor no application for inspection (filing) shall be accepted nor shall any inspection be scheduled until the new, properly licensed plumbing contractor has paid a "take over fee" of fifty dollars ($50.00) and a minimum application fee of twenty-one dollars ($21.00) (totaling seventy-one dollars ($71.00)) through the appropriate section of the department of inspection and code enforcement. When all applicable fees have been paid and proper license is provided the appropriate section shall make the necessary adjustments to the department's records and the trades work may be reconvened.
