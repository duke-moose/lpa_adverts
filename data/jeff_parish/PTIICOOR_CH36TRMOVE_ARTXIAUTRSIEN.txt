The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the following meanings:
Photographic traffic signal enforcement system shall mean a system that: 1) consists of a camera system installed to work in conjunction with an electrically-operated traffic-control signal, and 2) is capable of producing at least two (2) recorded images and a sub image that depict the license plate attached to the rear of a motor vehicle that is not operated in compliance with the instructions of the traffic control signal. A license plate sub image must be obtainable from one (1) of the two (2) recorded images.
Recorded image means an image recorded by a photographic traffic monitoring system that depicts the rear of a motor vehicle and is automatically recorded on a photographic or digital image.
Sub image means an image that clearly shows and accurately reflects visible display of the license plate attached to the back of the vehicle as required by Louisiana law. The sub image must be clear so that there is no dispute to the accuracy of the reflected image necessary to identify the violating vehicle.
System location means the approach to an intersection toward which a photographic traffic monitoring system is directed and in operation.
Traffic control signal shall mean any type of traffic signal whether manually, electrically, or mechanically operated, by which traffic is alternately directed to stop and permitted to proceed by the use of red, amber and green lights, arrows or their equivalents.
Vehicle owner means the actual registered owner of the vehicle or any driver of the vehicle who reasonably appears to have authority to operate the vehicle. Vehicle owner also includes a lessee of a motor vehicle under a lease contract with an automobile dealership, or a lessee of a motor vehicle rented or leased from a motor vehicle rental or leasing company, but does not include the motor vehicle rental or leasing company itself.

(a)
When the violation is issued pursuant to the ordinance for an alleged violation the vehicle owner is the person responsible for the payment of the fine. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the person whose name the vehicle is registered was the operator of the vehicle at the time the alleged violation was committed. Additionally, any operator of a vehicle who is not the vehicle owner, but who uses or operates the vehicle with the permission of the owner, express or implied, shall be considered the agent of the owner to receive the violation required to be sent to the vehicle owner. When the vehicle owner appears to have violated this article, he/she will be issued a notice of violation that will include both the recorded image and sub image. Before the notice is sent to the vehicle owner, the violation will be reviewed by both the company that owns the enforcement equipment and the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office to ensure that the violation is accurately recorded.
(b)
The vehicle owner will have thirty (30) days to respond to the violation notice by either paying the fine or contesting the fine.
(c)
Failure to perform by paying the fine or contesting the fine will result in a second notification to the vehicle owner, and an additional late payment penalty of a minimum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
(d)
If after the second notification the vehicle owner fails to pay the fine or contest the fine, then the violation will be sent to the Jefferson Parish First and Second Parish Courts, and processed for review by the Jefferson Parish District Attorney's Office to be handled in a manner consistent with that of a parking violation.

The parish council finds and determines that a vehicle that proceeds into an intersection when the traffic signal for that vehicle's direction of travel is emitting a steady red signal damages the public by endangering motor vehicle operators and pedestrians alike, by decreasing the efficiency of traffic control and traffic flow efforts, and by increasing the number of serious accidents to which public safety agencies must respond at the expense of the taxpayers.
The registered owner of a motor vehicle which proceeds into an intersection at a system location when the traffic control signal for the motor vehicle's direction of travel is emitting a steady red signal shall be liable for a minimum penalty of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) plus any additional costs assessed for the enforcement of this article, but in no event shall the total fine plus enforcement costs exceed one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175.00) per violation. Notwithstanding the limitations on the amount of the fine imposed under this article, however, any court which handles any part of the prosecution for a violation under this article may impose costs upon the person responsible for the fine in addition to the fine and enforcement costs imposed under this article.

The registered owner of a vehicle that proceeds into an intersection when the traffic signal for that vehicle's direction of travel is emitting a steady red signal who alleges that he was not the driver of the vehicle at the time of the violation has the responsibility through sworn statement to prove that someone else other than the vehicle owner was driving the vehicle at the time the violation occurred. The vehicle owner's sworn statement must provide the name, address, and contact phone number for the person whom the vehicle owner alleges was driving the vehicle. Failure to file a statement with the proper information will result in owner's continued liability for any fines and costs assessed for the violation. In addition, failure of the person alleged by the vehicle owner to have been driving the vehicle at the time of the violation to pay any and all fines or costs assessed for said violation shall result in the continued liability of the vehicle owner for said fines and costs.
