[Reconnection.] In the event that water services are discontinued, services shall be reconnected upon proof of compliance with the requirements of this code or upon court order and after payment of any fees due the water department.
(d)
Disconnection. Should it be necessary for an authorized representative to cause water services to be discontinued, such shall only occur after due notification.

(a)
Consumption charges and service charges. There is hereby established a water consumption charge and a water service charge for the use of water and other services delivered and rendered by Consolidated Waterworks District No. 1 of the Parish of Jefferson for all residences, apartment houses, multiple-family dwelling units, mobile homes, public, parochial and private schools, academies and other such training institutions, all churches, synagogues, temples and other places of worship, and all orphanages, and other not-for-profit, residential institutions. Base charges for water consumption and water service are dependent on the quantity of water used in gallons and the size of the water meter, respectively. Base charges will be adjusted annually beginning March 1, 2000 and thereafter every January 1st based on the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. The annual adjustment to these charges will equal a U.S. City Average 12 month percentage change in the All Urban Consumers—All Items Index (CPI-U) as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The actual rates for water consumption and water service in effect for any given year will be published in the Official Journal of Jefferson Parish and in the Progressive Jefferson, the publication ordinarily accompanying the water bills themselves.
(b)
Installation costs for water meters. Consolidated Waterworks District No. 1 of the Parish of Jefferson is hereby authorized to charge actual installation costs incurred in the installation of all new and/or additional meters. Costs of installation for various size meters will be posted in the water department annually and the meter installation charge is due and payable in full at the time the application is made.
(c)
Deposit on newly established accounts. In order to ensure payment of the common utility bill, a cash deposit on all newly established accounts is required. The cash deposit is to be held in surety of payment of all charges that appear on the department of water common utility bill. The cash deposit is to be placed by the applicant at the time application for service is made. The applicant must be eighteen (18) years or older to apply for water service in his or her name. The account of cash deposit is related to the water meter size, number of units and type of service (residence, business, etc.). The basic cash deposits required are:
Type Deposit Meter Size
Single Residence 5/8 by ¾ inch $75.00
Commercial 5/8 by ¾ inch 100.00

Commercial 1 inch 125.00
Residence 2 inch 150.00
Commercial 2 inch 300.00
Commercial 3 inch 500.00
Commercial 4 inch 750.00
  The above cash deposits are minimum amounts for the meter size indicated. Meters that exceed four (4) inches will require the maximum deposit of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Multiple units that are being serviced by an individual meter shall multiply the number of units times the charge for the above listed applicable meter size. The maximum deposit required regardless of number of units is five hundred dollars ($500.00). Interest earned on all deposits is factored into our public rates, helping to keep rates down, therefore, no interest is paid to customers on deposits. Likewise, the Jefferson Parish Water Department has the right to increase a deposit in order to protect itself against nonpayment.
(d)
Fire service, sprinkler system or internal fire protection system.
(1)
Cost of installation. All applicants for water service connections in Consolidated Waterworks District No. 1 of the Parish of Jefferson for the purpose of a sprinkler system or internal fire protection system shall pay the cost of all labor, equipment and material, plus ten (10) percent of each installation cost from the water mains to the property line of applicant.

Meter requirement. Where fire service, sprinkler system or internal fire protection system is required by a customer, no meter will be installed, but the customer shall be required to pay for the cost of fire service installation as set forth above. No connections shall be made to the fire service lines other than the usual sprinkler system and fire hose connections. All other use of water must be metered.
(3)
Fire service rates. The rate for fire services shall be a monthly or bi-monthly charge basis, payable in advance on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. Fire service rates, private fire protection service shall be based on the size of connection as follows:
Size of Connection:
4 inch pipe and smaller
6 inch pipe
8 inch pipe
10 inch pipe
12 inch pipe
14 inch pipe
The base charge for the fire service rates will be adjusted annually beginning January 1, 2002, based on the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. The annual adjustment will equal a U.S. City Average twelve-month percentage change in the All Urban Consumers—All Items Index (CPI-U) as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI adjusted charges are published annually in the Official Journal of Jefferson Parish and in the Progressive Jefferson, the publication ordinarily accompanying the water bills themselves.

Should it be found that the water is being used contrary to existing rules, rates and regulations, the supply shall be shut off and not restored until a proper accounting has been made and all claims paid.
(q)
Obtaining water service by subterfuge. Water shall not be turned on or supplied to any premises, either directly or indirectly, when the occupant is in arrears at the place then occupied.

(v)
Discontinuance of water service by customers. Customers desiring to discontinue the use of water shall give notice of same before vacating the premises named in the application.

Each estimated bill shall be stamped, properly explaining that the bill has been estimated in accordance with the rules and regulations governing the billing of water, and if the consumer is dissatisfied with such an estimation, it shall be incumbent upon him to prove to the department of water, by affidavit, that his use of water during the period for which the bill was estimated, was less than the corresponding period for the year previous. Upon presentation of such satisfactory proof, the proper officials of the department shall be authorized to proceed with readjusting this bill upon any basis that they may deem equitable and just to the consumer and to the parish jointly, as for example, rendering an average bill based upon the consumption for the previous three (3) months, or rendering a bill based upon an average of the preceding month and the subsequent month.
(y)
Meter tests. Meters shall be tested upon application of the consumer. If the meter is found to be inaccurate to the detriment of the consumer or the parish, it shall be replaced with an accurate one.

d.
Consumer or customer. The consumer of the parish public potable water supply has the primary responsibility for preventing pollutants and contaminants from entering his potable water system or the public potable water systems.
(3)
Procedures. All procedures are fully outlined below and variations from these procedures will be allowed only by supervisory approval from the department responsible for that phase of operation.
a.
Existing facilities:
1.
Selection of existing installations for investigations:
i.
Selection of existing installations for investigation shall be made solely on the basis of "suspected hazard." These fields for investigation are taken from a list prepared by representatives from all concerned departments.
ii.
List of suspected high hazard installations: The following general fields of installations will be investigated in the order of their listing:
Funeral homes;
Hospitals (clinics, etc.);
Plating and chemical companies;
Labs (industrial and medical);
Packing houses;
Manufacturing plants.
iii.
List of suspected low hazards:
Schools with lab;
Nursing and convalescent homes;
Hotels and motels;
Car washes and service stations;
Laundry and cleaners;
Restaurants and food handlers;
Major office buildings;
Apartment houses (high rise over thirty-six (36) feet high).
2.
Appointments. In most cases attempts will be made to secure an appointment with a representative of the building owner. Appointments will be made or approved by the crossconnection control supervisor and will be made by mutual agreement of consumer and parish.
3.
Survey. All surveys or investigations will be made in the following manner:
i.
The inspectors. An inspector from the cross-connection control group will contact the consumer in person at the appointed time. He will briefly explain the objective of the survey and will ask the consumer or his appointed agent to accompany him during his tour of the consumer's facilities.
ii.
Discussion with consumer. Any physical or seriously potential crossconnections that are discovered will be pointed out to the consumer and explained. The inspector will also point out plumbing problems that might result in poor pressure and/or wastage of water and will attempt to offer suggestions for improvement of these problems.
iii.
Forms. When cross-connections are found to exist a written notice will be filled out in triplicate by the inspector. He will make every effort to be sure that the information entered on the form is accurate and complete, and will state on the notice how the hazards are to be corrected. Upon completion of the survey, the inspector will sign the notice and will request the consumer's signature also.
iv.
Records. The top (original) copy of the notice will be given to the consumer upon completion of the survey. The second copy is returned to the supervisor of crossconnection control. The third copy will be retained by the inspector in the notice book. When the case is closed, the second copy with all appropriate notations will be permanently filed and the third copy will be destroyed.
4.
Committee action. When unusual circumstances are encountered by the cross-connection section, that are not in line with established policies, they shall be brought before the crossconnection liaison committee for a discussion. The committee shall meet whenever necessary to review policies and to establish new policies to guide the program.
5.
Notification and follow-up the department of inspection and code enforcement. A letter of notification to the property owner, including references to related ordinances and information as to what corrective measures are necessary, time limits, etc., shall be written and signed by the chief of the plumbing inspection division when necessary for follow-up. Subsequent follow-up letters will also be written whenever necessary to secure compliance. In case of noncompliance, when discontinuance of water service is necessary, a written request will be made to the water department to the attention of the director, through the director of inspection and code enforcement. The water department will then handle the actual discontinuance.
6.
Permits, installation and inspection. After the owner receives written notification, it becomes his responsibility to correct the situation or install the appropriate device. A licensed plumber shall secure a permit from the plumbing inspection division in accordance with the parish plumbing code. An inspector from the plumbing inspection division will inspect and approve or disapprove the completed installation or testing procedure. The cross-connection control supervisor shall at regular intervals send a report of the activities of the section to all members of the cross-connection committee.
7.
Records and tests. Upon receipt of notice from the plumbing inspector, a permanent record file is set up in cross-connection control group. In order to ensure that backflow preventer devices continue to operate satisfactorily, it will be necessary that they be periodically tested. Such tests will be conducted in accordance with manufacturer's performance standards and test procedures.
8.
Emergency procedures. If any employee of the parish should discover a hazardous situation where contaminants are actually in the process or suspected of entering the distribution system of the department of water, he is authorized to take such immediate steps as necessary to stop backflow. He is further responsible for contacting the water department without delay and notifying the supervisor of distribution of the need for flushing the contaminants out of the system.

3.
Permits, installations and inspections. The plumbing contractor will secure a plumbing permit from the plumbing inspection division in accordance with the parish plumbing code. In conjunction with his inspection of all the plumbing in the new building, a plumbing inspector will inspect and approve or disapprove the completed backflow preventer installation. After approval, in accordance with plumbing codes and cross-connection control rules and regulations, a report from the plumbing inspector will be sent to cross-connection control section. This report will state kind, size, location and any other pertinent details of the installation.
4.
Records and tests. Upon receipt of notice from the plumbing inspector, a permanent record file is set up in the cross-connection control group. In order to ensure that backflow prevention devices continue to operate satisfactorily, it will be necessary that they be periodically tested. Such test will be conducted in accordance with manufacturer's performance standards and test procedures, in the presence of an inspector from the plumbing section of the department of inspection and code enforcement crossconnection control group. An inspection receipt will be given to the licensed plumber requesting inspection, upon completion of inspection. Inspectors assigned to the cross-connection control group will conduct the tests. All such periodic testing shall be at the customer's expense.
5.
Cost of inspection. Cost of test inspection will be ten dollars ($10.00) per device three-fourths-inch through three-inch, twenty dollars ($20.00) per device four (4) inches and up.

Cross-connections and storage tanks:
a.
The definition of a cross-connection, as based upon the U. S. Department of Health, Education and Public Welfare's Public Health Service, is any physical connection or arrangement of pipes between two (2) otherwise separate water supply systems, one (1) of which contains potable water and the other water of unknown or questionable safety, whereby water may flow from one (1) system to the other, the direction of flow depending on pressure differential between the two (2) systems.
b.
No cross-connection shall be permitted to be made between any system of piping supplied by water from the mains of the department of water and any other source of supply, either public or private; or any secondary supplies known to be unsafe for drinking water, such as shallow wells, reused industrial supplies, raw surface water or swimming pools.
c.
Where parish water is used as an auxiliary supply to a roof or suction tank, which is also supplied by water from any other source, such tank shall not be of the pressure type but open. The delivery of parish water shall be above the tank flow line and controlled by some type of automatic valve.
d.
It shall be unlawful, also, to maintain storage tanks supplied only with parish water unless the tanks are satisfactorily built, and covered so as to prevent the entrance of contamination, They shall also be subject to periodical inspection by the waterworks department and maintained in a manner wholly satisfactory to the standards and requirements of the state department of health. Pumps taking suction from the parish supply, serving such building storage, shall be installed or operated only upon permit from the department of water subject to their approval as to size, capacity and valving arrangements.
e.
It shall be unlawful for anyone to interconnect private supplies, including deep well systems, with the department of water system except as hereinafter provided:
1.
Correction and maintenance, in a manner satisfactory to the state department of health and department of water of the parish, of all existing sanitary defects in and around the private supply system;
2.
Provision to be made for complete bacteriological analysis by the department of water of the supply involved, in accordance with the standard methods of water analysis of the American Public Health Association. This requirement means not less than four (4) analyses each month of two (2) standard samples, or more often, if the analyses warrant;
3.
Provision by the owner of the private system involved to pay an equitable pro rata part of the cost of all inspections and testing herein required. The rates and method of paying for the same shall be determined by the department of water subject to the approval of the director of water.
f.
Should any system supplied by parish water be operated in violation of any provision of this article, it shall be the duty of the department of water to completely disconnect all service lines serving such system until this section is properly complied with. Any cost of such disconnection and the estimated cost of reconnection must be paid by the consumer before service shall be restored.
