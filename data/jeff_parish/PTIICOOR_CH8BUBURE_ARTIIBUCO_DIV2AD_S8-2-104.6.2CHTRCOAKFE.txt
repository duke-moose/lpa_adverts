If, on a job, there is a change in the licensed electrician no application for inspection (filing) shall be accepted for said job nor shall any inspection be scheduled until the new, properly licensed electrician has paid a "take over fee" of fifty dollars ($50.00) and a minimum application fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) (totaling sixty-five dollars ($65.00)) through the appropriate section of the department. When all applicable fees have been paid and proper license is provided the appropriate section shall make the necessary adjustments to the department's records and the trades work may be reconvened.
