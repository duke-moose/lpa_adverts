It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. Sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and the Louisiana Employment Discrimination Law, R.S. § 23:332 et seq. All persons have a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Jefferson Parish prohibits sexual harassment of any person by any officer, agent, elected official, employee, agency, commission, board, committee or department of the parish on the basis of sex or gender. While in the course and scope of employment, all officers, agents, commissions, boards, committees, elected officials, employees, agencies or departments are prohibited from sexually harassing a person, regardless of any employment relationship.
