A properly issued building permit shall carry with it the right to perform the work detailed on the drawings and/or specifications or documents submitted for the permit. But, such issued building permit shall not authorize any party to, under any circumstances, violate any provisions of this chapter.
Any performed commercial construction work omitted or not clearly shown on the drawings, specifications or documents submitted for permit is unauthorized. In such instances additional, separate permits may be required and the non-permitted work shall cease until the properly authorizing permit is obtained.
An electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing application for inspection (filing) once accepted, shall authorize the commencement of the work filed. Any electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing filing related to construction which requires a building permit shall have the issued permit number shown on the application and shall not be accepted until the building permit is properly issued. All work authorized by permit or filing acceptance shall be performed in strict accordance with all provisions of this chapter.
