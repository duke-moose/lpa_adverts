Upon notice from the code official, work on any building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system that is being done prior to securing the required permit or prior to filing the proper application for inspection or is being performed contrary to the provisions of this chapter or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his agent, or to the person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. A placard stating "stop work order" shall be conspicuously posted on such premises where the violation occurred.

Where an emergency exists, the code official shall not be required to give a written notice prior to stopping the work.
