At the option of the code official, special, same-day inspections may be considered and performed. Whenever an inspection of any electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing service system is desired the same day as the inspection application is filed and/or inspection requested. If approved, a special same-day inspection fee shall be paid. Said special inspection fee shall be fifty dollars ($50.00). Same-day inspection requests must be made at least three (3) hours before the desired inspection time and the requested inspection shall be scheduled and completed during normal business hours. (See Table 104.9.3 for plumbing exemptions from special, same-day inspections.) For outside normal business hours inspection fees, see section 104.4.2.
