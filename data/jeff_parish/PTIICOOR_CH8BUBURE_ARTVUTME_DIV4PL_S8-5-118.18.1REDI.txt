The chief plumbing inspector of the department of inspection and code enforcement, or his designated agent shall inspect the plumbing in every building or premises in this parish as frequently as in his judgment may be necessary to ensure that such plumbing has been installed in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of pollution of the water supply of the parish by the plumbing. The chief plumbing inspector or his designee shall notify or cause to be notified in writing the owner or authorized agent of the owner of any such building or premises, to correct, within a reasonable time set by the chief plumbing inspector or his designee any plumbing installed or existing contrary to or in violation of this ordinance, and which in his judgment may therefore permit the pollution of the parish water supply, or otherwise adversely affect the public health.
