No person shall commence any work which requires a building permit, until said building permit has been properly issued and the building permit placard is conspicuously displayed on the premises where the permitted work is to occur. (See also section 8-22 of the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances). Further, no property owner shall allow anyone (i.e.: contractor) to begin construction, which requires a building permit, until the building permit issued and placard is conspicuously displayed on their premises. The building permit placard shall be protected from the weather and the workplace environment and kept in good condition. The placard shall be located in such a position on the premises to allow the code official, or representative, to be easily and continually observed. The posted placard shall authorize the admittance of the code official onto the premises to perform any required duties upon the posted premises. The permit holder shall maintain the permit placard in the approved position and condition until the code official issues the certificate of completion.
