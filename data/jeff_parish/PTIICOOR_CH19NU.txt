The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the protection and promotion of the public health, safety and welfare by regulating and eliminating those nuisances which have a negative impact upon the quality of life, safety and health of the neighborhoods where they are located. This chapter is enacted to also prevent the spread of disease; to limit and prevent the harborage of insects, rodents, and other vermin; to limit and prevent accumulations of filth, sewage, garbage, refuse, debris; to limit and prevent depreciation of property values and disturbance of another's peaceful possession of his property due to a person's actions or property constituting a violation of the conditions of this chapter. The foregoing also includes but is not limited to the regulation of property that is blighted as blight causes deterioration and instability in neighborhoods and has an adverse impact on neighboring properties. Further, vacant, unsecured and/or boarded structures are a major cause and source of blight as such unkempt structures and long-term vacancies discourage economic development, retard appreciation of property values and decrease the quality of life.
