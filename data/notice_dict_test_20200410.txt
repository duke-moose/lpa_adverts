Utility Report-Todd Abshire (Absent) A report was sent to the Clerk as per Todd Abshire and was given to the Mayor and Council Members. Water-March 16, 2020 a Dollar Store delivery truck ran over a hydrant near the Dollar General. The hydrant valve was closed off and has been removed. They are in the process of getting price quotes for repair from a few local contractors so they can bill the delivery truck's insurance once repairs are made. EPA has issued a statement regarding the COVID-19 virus stating that this virus cannot live in a chlorinated environment. As long as they are within the EPA/LDH chlorine residual requirements, the drinking water remains safe. The monthly Safe Drinking Water Act daily chlorine residual logs were verified by Todd Abshire and are on file in the utility office filing cabinet as required by law. Wastewater- The monthly flow records were faxed to HoPak Laboratories to verify flow in accordance with the discharge permit, as well as all analytical results being examined, reported and filed in the appropriate filing cabinet in the utility department files. Gas- The gas system is operating near 40 pounds of inlet pressure at the Cypress Station and 50 psi at Koch Station. Todd is working on a water and wastewater rate study as requested by the Mayor and he should have the results before the beginning of the new fiscal year budget proposed. Police ReportChief Eddy LeCompte As it falls to the Chief to do everything possible to secure and protect the citizens of Arnaudville, he has in the past relied on the good relationship he has with the sheriffs of both parishes during times of critical need. He did, as previously, engage St. Landry Parish Sheriff's Office to provide for officers to fill gaps. However, he was later informed that he failed to follow steps for establishing a formal contract. He wished to apologize to the Council and the Town Attorney for not following procedure. His primary concern was, is and always will be Arnaudville's safety, in his attention to delivery of services. He failed to be as concerned over the administrative bureaucracy that is necessary for all Mayors and towns to oversee. Having met with the Mayor after he abruptly terminated the arrangement, he suggested that he bring the request to the council for proper approval in order to implement a formal contract. As I explained to the Mayor, there was no intention to purposefully circumvent proper procedure. The past practices in this area had never come under scrutiny before, and given the fact that he was covering the costs under the approved budget, Chief perceived no obstacles to proceed. Chief does recognize, in fairness to the Mayor, that the nature of the need and the length of time he would need assistance was more than usual. So in order to address his oversight, in order to prevent the interruption of services to Arnaudville citizens, he is asking the Council to approve and open contract (employed on an as needed basis) with St. Landry and St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Department, and with that, approve the payment (negotiated or otherwise) affiliated with that contract, to be reviewed on an annual basis. In regards to the staffing of full time Patrol Officers he is continuing his protracted search to obtain suitable candidates Contrary to what some of you think, recruiting candidates for Patrol Officers is not a \"come on in, we'll talk and if you seem qualified I'll hire you\" type situation. Here is the typical scenario, not unlike most law enforcement agencies today. Over the past two months he has been in contact and interviewed nearly 30 candidates. These interviews are time consuming and intense, but despite his due diligence, over half were deemed unacceptable after the initial interview. If the remaining 15 passed the initial interview they were asked to return for a psychological examination. More than half of those asked to return did not do so, or had an appointment set but failed to come in at the appointed time. Of the six (out of 30) who did return to take the exam only two were deemed acceptable by Risk Management to be covered by insurance. He currently has three candidates being reviewed: One had taken his exam through another agency and he is waiting for that agency to email or mail him a copy of his results; one who did not complete the exam and is now working, and will not be able to return to finish it until the end of the month and finally one who will have to be set up to take the exam sometime this week. He hopes that by the end of this week he will have at least one applicant that will be eligible for hiring, if the council will expedite with a special meeting set up for approval. On Thursday, March 26, 2020 Neighborhood Watch meeting has been cancelled. An attempt to reschedule will be made for either during the month of May or June. Chief stated in the past, all residents of the 70512 area zip code are invited to attend. When a salary adjustment was approved by the Council at the last meeting for the Patrol Officers he informed the Council that he would ask for an adjustment to the pay for dispatchers. As such, chief request that the starting pay for Dispatchers be $9.02 per hour (Grade 1, Step 33). After 6 months of satisfactory service the pay would increase to $9.58 per hour (Grade 1, Step 39). These adjustments would be effective immediately. He also would like the Council to approve adjustments for longevity in that a dollar an hour adjustment would be made for those working five (5)years, ten(10) years, fifteen (15) years and twenty (20) years. Therefore a Dispatcher with 5 years working would receive $10.58 per hour (Grade2, Step 7), with ten (10) years $11.64 per hour (Grade 2, Step 15) with (15) years @12.69 per hour (Grade 2 Step 23) and finally after twenty (20) years $13.74 per hour (Grade 3, Step 31). In short, these adjustments would show appreciation to the time and dedication of the Dispatchers for their loyalty on the job. These adjustments, for service time, would not become effective until the 2020-2021 budget years. This adjustment would currently only apply to two (2) employees. Chief petitioned the Council to approve the hiring of Ms. Tiffany Taylor to the position of Dispatcher. Chief stated that all the Council members had received Tiffany's application. The rate of pay for Ms. Taylor would be $9.02 per hour (Grade 1, Step 33). Likewise he petitioned the Council to adjust the pay of Dispatcher Delores Neal to the same pay being approved for Ms. Taylor. Chief recommended that Reserve Officer Jair Stelly be allowed to assume patrol duties on his own. Reserve PO Stelly has been sufficiently trained, for the past year, in what duties a Patrol Officer has. Further, Reserve PO Stelly would still have a full time Department Officer on the same shift he would be manning. He asked that approve be granted to Reserve PO Stelly be allowed to assume patrol duties on his own and that he be placed on the automobile insurance police as an approved driver. Statistics for the month of February were: 2 arrests. 6 citations, 2 MIC's issued, 3 FIC's and 78 calls for service. Statistics are low because almost a quarter of patrol time was covered by other agencies. With respect to the current crisis concerning COVID-19, the department is closely monitoring the situation with the State, other Municipal Law Enforcement Agencies and local Parish leaders. The situation is very fluid and changes are happening at a very fast pace. Chief said that if he feels that the Police Department should adopt any new steps to protect the employees and the citizens of Arnaudville he will contact the Mayor to keep him informed. Mayor said he wanted to clarify something what chief said about him abruptly terminated the contract, Mayor stated the he did not abruptly terminate the contract because there was no contract. Chief said he did not know it was a contract and thought this was an agreement with the Sheriff Department. Jamie Huval motioned to approve the adjustments for the longevity seconded by Debbie Kidder, motion carried. Jamie Huval motioned to approve the hiring of Tiffany Taylor seconded by Cynthia Stelly and Suzanne Stelly, motion passed. Jamie Huval motioned to change the step for pay for dispatchers seconded by Suzanne Stelly, motion passed. Jamie Huval motioned that the council adjusts the pay of Delores Neal to $9.02 per hour seconded by Debbie Kidder and Cynthia Stelly, motion carried. Kevin Robin questioned Chief about entering into an agreement with Sheriff Guidroz and asked where in the budget was this going to be taken from. Chief said he has never used the Sheriff Department for a long length of time but this time he had to. Chief said his plan was to take it out of the budget where he was under budget. Kevin said before entering into an agreement you have to make sure the money is there to pay those individuals. Kevin stated that they taught they had reached high ground and all would start working together. Kevin thanked Sheriff Guidroz for the work they provided to the town and wants to pay him for his services. Kevin feels that they need to table the payment until some kind of legal agreement can be reached with the guidelines. Cynthia said her concern is perhaps having the Sheriff staffed to do the patrols at $40.00 an hour instead of hiring someone at regular wage to fill the gaps. Chief said he wishes that someone would talk to him about making plans for anything that needs to be discussed. Jamie Huval said he and Debbie Kidder went to speak with the Chief and the whole time they were in the chief office the conversation was about annexing and nothing to do with the police department. Kevin Robin told chief to stay in his lane and follow the Lawrason Act; the streets need to be patrolled. Mayor stated that as far as an agreement goes he would be happy to present something to the council if that is the avenue they choose. A line item would have to be added to the budget to add contract laborers. Mayor Meche thanked the Sheriff for the assistance his officers provided for the town. Mayor stated that the payment due to the Sheriff's office will have to be approved by the council members. The budget will have to be amended in order to pay the sheriff. Jamie said that in no way is he in favor of not having a Police Dept., but the department cannot stay staffed. Chief feels that the increase in the pay will go a long way and encourage people to stay on. Chief also stated that added benefits such as insurance would encourage officers. Kevin said the Council added in good faith to raise the salaries, Kevin said his door is always open and he knows Chief door is open as well, but doors swing both ways. Kevin stated that the council knows there is not an adequately staffed police department. Kevin said the Chief should have had a discussion with the board members to avoid all of the unnecessary happenings. Kevin said it is time to press the reset button and all work together. Cynthia Stelly motioned to table the paying of the bill for the Sheriff's office and look at a contract from the Sheriff's office seconded by Suzanne Stelly, motion passed. Kevin Robin made a motion to table Reserve Officer Jair Stelly (Reserve Officer) to allow him to patrol alone, seconded by Debbie Kidder, motion passed. Sheriff DepartmentSheriff Bobby Guidroz Sheriff Guidroz explained that he is not at the meeting to demand payment for the work performed by his officers. If the bill has to be forgiven he is willing to do so. Sheriff stated that when the Chief called him and asked for help in the past Sheriff gave him deputies, but the Sheriff department would pay the overtime. Sheriff explained that he has to look out for his budget. Sheriff said that he was neglectful about not checking with the mayor. Sheriff Guidroz said that he will work with the Chief to provide protection. He is paying his deputies $17.00 per hour; he said these small towns cannot pay that kind of money. The day has come to where the small towns cannot police their own community because of lack of resources and lack of manpower. Sheriff explained that he is willing to offer a proposal to the Council. There are surrounding Parishes that a begging for help from the Sheriff's office. Sheriff Guidroz asked chief to take his responsibilities seriously in making sure his police officers are doing their jobs correctly. To contract as an outside agency to patrol the area 3 things have to happen, 1. The people have to request this. 2. The Council has to abolish the chief's budget and the chief stays on until the end of his term. 3. The Legislature has to say OK and have this approved. Sheriff stated that by far he is not at the meeting to take the Chief's job. Sheriff said no one should support wrong things. Debbie Kidder inquired about the Sheriff Department policing the town and wanted to know if the officer would stay here in town and the Sheriff replied that the officer would stay in Arnaudville. Kevin also mentioned the importance of the jail tax renewal. St. Martin Parish Council on AgingBurton Dupuis Mr. Burton is the Chairman of the St. Martin Parish Council on aging. Mr. Dupuis explained what Council on ages aids the elderly people who qualify, such as providing congregate and home delivered meals, nutritional education, information and assistance, outreach, material aid, home repairs, utility assistance, homemakers, recreation, legal assistance, disease prevention, health promotion, and transportation. Blighted PropertySuzanne Stelly Suzanne Stelly spoke to the mayor about a few areas of concern she has about the blighted property. Mayor explained that letters were sent out to property owners about their blighted property. Steps are being taken to arrest the blighted property issues. United WayGinger LeCompte Ginger is the Executive Director for St. Landry and Evangeline Parishes. Ginger presented information on the Coronavirus, some of the impacts that are happening or will happen. Ginger said that they are supporting a central location called 211; they are connected with the Department of Health and other government agencies. This operation is up dated on a daily basis. Police Department and CouncilWillie Wyble Willie Wyble stated that it has been over 30 days and he has not received his Police Report. He said he received 3 reports and none of them are correct and wants to know when he will receive a correct copy. Chief said he did not know what Willie is talking about because the officer goes out there and talks to the individual or tries to talk to the individual. Chief said at the time of the accident Chief said he was not informed. The officer went out there and thought there was a very dangerous situation, he was not aware that Mr. Wyble was an expert; if he (the chief) would have been there he would have probably told him what needed to be done. The officer was trying to keep everyone safe. Chief said he had a discussion with the police officer and is trying to have him produce a correct report. The officer will be working on his report tonight (3/17/2020) and the report will be ready 3/18/2020. Willie said he wants the officers to know that he works for the church and does go to the cemetery at night and he is not out there to steal bodies he is doing his job. Resolution 01-2020 WMPP (Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality)Mayor Jamie Huval moved to accept Resolution 01-2020 seconded by Kevin Robin, motion carried. Resolution 02-2020 A Resolution of the Mayor and Town Council of the Town of Arnaudville in Opposition of all proposed Legislation that enables the Legislature to Remove the Authority of Local Governments to administer and collect local sales and use taxesMayor Jamie Huval moved to accept Resolution 02-2020 seconded by Debbie Kidder and Kevin Robin, motion carried. Up-Date on Drainage, Water Well, Sewer, Generators, RoadsMayor The audit was done from pipeline safety on the gas, there is a gas loss, a study was done and there is multiple gas meters that should have been replaced due to being old meters. A plan has to be put together to give to pipeline safety, it is recommended to change out some of the commercial gas meters. Changing out the meters would be approximately $7000.00. Mayor said he needs a motion to adopt a Resolution to cover the expenses. Jamie Huval moved to accept the Resolution seconded by Debbie Kidder, motion passed. Residential meters are being looked at as well; there are old meters that are being inventoried so the cost can be added to the next fiscal year budget. The generators are all fixed and running, there were some major issues with the generators, but everything is up and ready for the storm season. The drainage project is winding down weather permitted it should be completed in a couple of weeks. A change order was done for the $15,000 the town had from St. Landry Solid Waste to complete road patching. Patching did take place is some areas of town, but there is plenty more patching that needs to take place. Mayor is working on plans to see what steps will be taken for the next fiscal year to give to the Council. On Mills Street there was an issue with the sewer lift station, Griner was called out and the pump was un-repairable. The pump had to be replaced. There will be overages in the budget this year due to major repairs. Specs are being drawn for the water plant and hopefully this can be put in the next budget. The water line at the water well had a rupture in the main pipe; a contractor had to fix that problem as well. Citizens' Concern There were concerns about plans on a local level for the Coronavirus for people who are compromised. The board members did offer their services to the public. Mayor also suggested utilizing 211 for information and also calling City Hall so we can try and help anyone in need. Kevin Robin thanked Jamie Huval for wanting to help the constituents. Adjourn Kevin Robin moved to adjourn the March 17, 2020 Regular Town Meeting seconded by Debbie Kidder and Jamie Huval, motion carried. Attest: _____________________ Dolores R.

Bourgeois and A. Ostheimer reported Picciola & Associates continues to develop alternatives to the preliminary design and budgets for the proposed three phases of this levee reach and feel confident NLLD will be able to return with some projects that can be pushed forward likely in a future budget. The culvert that was installed through the levee has degraded to a point that water is flowing around the pipe and the gate has fallen off so there is no way to stop the flow during certain tidal events. It also is degrading the levee as the water flows around the pipe. The NLLD is working with Picciola to install a new pipe consistent with plans for the levee improvement. In order to perform this work, an access point needs to be built from LA 1 to the 40 Arpent Canal. NLLD has discussed this with a couple of different landowners and are moving towards finalizing a right of way agreement. Picciola is working on a design for the access, 40 Arpent crossing, and replacement of the pipe in order to get this work done ASAP. NLLD received the permit with mitigation quantity from the USACE for the first phase of Reach B that the NLLD is currently reviewing. D. Kiffe asked what condition are these levees in. A. Ostheimer said the area NLLD is looking to improve first is in the worst condition at a low elevation and looking to raise it to a +4\ufffd. The levee area where the pipe goes through is not at a bad elevation, but it does not meet NLLD\ufffds criteria. In the future, NLLD will widen the levee. Discussion ensued about NLLD revaluating the cost of the project because D. Bourgeois would like to get the price down. Comeaux Drive Drainage Project: D. Bourgeois reported the NLLD and the Town of Lockport have had studies and work done since early 2018 to get resolution for their drainage problems. Leonard Chauvin P.E., Inc. is advancing the design and ROW requirements to help the Town pursue funding during the coming year and also plan to bring the Parish and LP DD#1 into the search for funding. There is still more to consider before I ask the board to consider the request for funding assistance made by the Town of Lockport for that purpose. D. Kiffe asked about P. Amedee\ufffds research on NLLD implementing ordinances on private property with a levee, motioned at the last meeting. P. Amedee provided a document of this information, but D. Bourgeois said this will be discussed at the March Board meeting. D. Choupic Project Area: Nothing to report E. St. James Project Area: D. Bourgeois and A. Ostheimer reported NLLD is developing items in the Project Area via this drainage study by Duplantis Design Group. The overall plan is to allow Thibodaux to develop this area in a proactive, forward looking way; to avoid trying to correct for unplanned difficult drainage issues in the future. DDG is creating a hydraulic model for this area. It will take several months to gather the input information. Equipment is set up and the real conditions during rainfall events need to be measured. F. Lake Bouef Watershed Project Area: Zeller/Larousse Forced Drainage Area Systems Improvements: D. Bourgeois and A. Ostheimer reported Sealevel Construction completed the work in 2018 on Phase 1A of this project which included clearing encroachments and dredging the reservoir.

Bourgeois and A. Ostheimer reported Sealevel Construction is the contractor for the hydraulic spray dredging of these canals and adjacent canals combined. They are currently dredging the 80 Arpent Canal. Overall they are about 71% complete with the overall dredging of the project. D. Kiffe made a motion, seconded by L. Andolsek to approve payment of pay request #11 in the amount of $112,145.12 from Sealevel Construction, Inc. as recommended by the project engineer. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. G. Gheens Project Area: Mathews Canal/Clotilda Levee Improvements Project: D. Bourgeois reported NLLD is waiting for the sloughed area to settle as previously reported. GIS will perform surveys of the cross sections to record the settlement in the area. Des Allemands Bulkhead Project: D. Bourgeois and A. Ostheimer reported All South Consulting Engineers (ASCE) is monitoring the small sloughing area and continuing to monitor the levee for settlement. ASCE has recommended the installation of additional material which will probably be sometime in March, depending of the weather. Des Allemands FDA Pump Improvement Project: D. Bourgeois and A. Ostheimer reported Sealevel Construction Inc. is the contractor on this project that has GOMESA funds committed and includes the construction of a new pump station in Des Allemands and the removal of the existing pump station. The Notice to Proceed was issued for January 6th , however, Entergy still needs to perform the relocation and the execution of the final RoW to begin the work. Sealevel currently has the pumps ordered and are procuring materials in expectation to begin work as soon as the lines are relocated. Jesse Dufrene FDA Levee Improvements: D. Bourgeois and A. Ostheimer reported Onshore Materials, LLC is the contractor for this project which has GOMESA funding committed through CPRA and designed to raise four miles of levee height from +4\ufffd to +7\ufffd. Onshore is continuing to backfill the force drainage canal which is part of the design to gain stability of the levee. They also are installing material along the levee. K. Matherne made a motion, seconded by R. Pitre to approve payment of pay application #6 in the amount of $54,826.64 from Onshore Materials, LLC as recommended by the project engineer. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. Natural Gas FDA Levee Improvements: D. Bourgeois and A. Ostheimer reported this is the other half of protection for Gheens Community and is a prime candidate for GOMESA funds if available; therefore, it should be shovel-ready. ASCE is working on the final design for this project with a plan of bidding the project out later this year. Upper Barataria Risk Reduction (UBRRP) Project: D. Bourgeois reported this project is included in the State\ufffds Master Plan for 2017 and the project team has spent some time working with CPRA on project details to help shape the action for the Corps\ufffd new start design funding. NLLD wants the Corps\ufffd efforts to blend in well with the design team and the efforts of CPRA. The Corps has released its draft report on their study of the project. Further, the NLLD and the LBLD have been working cooperatively to get this design further down the road. H. Valentine - East Project Area: New Valentine/Ludevine FDA: D. Bourgeois and A. Ostheimer reported this levee running from Hamilton St. in Larose about 5,500 feet towards the Ludevine Pump Station along the Blackwater Canal needs to be stabilized. The project is currently being advertising and Picciola & Associates held the pre-bid meeting at the NLLD office on Feb. 13 th with plans on receiving bids on March 3 rd and is expected to be awarded in the March Board meeting. C. Kief asked for the budget. It is a little over $1.3 million. Morganza to the Gulf Eastern Tie-in, reach 2 Interim Improvements: A. Ostheimer reported GIS is performing the topographic survey for the levee which is about 95% complete and the geotechnical work is progressing. We expect to have the information to review from GIS early to mid-March. Once we have that information GIS will begin to be able to put estimates together and we can begin forming this into projects. I. Regional/Other Capital Projects: Pump Station Study: D. Bourgeois and A. Ostheimer reported this project is extending NLLD\ufffds influence into the proper operation of the pumps in Lafourche Parish to prevent possible damage from over pumping. TBS has submitted the FDA reports. Once reviewed NLLD will return comments as necessary so that they can be finalized and the NLLD can work with LPG to implement. TBS has also installed monitoring equipment on the last set of pump stations as requested by the NLLD. Discussion ensued about current communicating issues between the NLLD and the LPG pump operator employees on the pump station monitoring system. NLLD\ufffds goal is to meet with them regularly to ensure they better understand the notifications/ranges of the water levels in order to pump properly. Morganza to the Gulf (MTG), Larose to Lockport Feasibility Report: D. Bourgeois and A. Ostheimer reported Mitch Marmande with Delta Coast (DCC) is working on the design of the actual alignment of the levee within NLLD District and had previously submitted the permit application for Reach 4 and is currently working on the application for Reach 1. DCC will continue to reply and submit additional information as necessary to the comments submitted. Morganza to the Gulf: D. Bourgeois reported NLLD is working on a sustained new push in an attempt to find funding for the federally authorized Morganza to the Gulf Project which now comes well into the jurisdiction of the NLLD. This push included a re-evaluation of their estimated cost of the project. NLLD has been working at all levels of the Corps, Louisiana Delegation in DC, State legislators and others in this effort. At this point, there is buy-in from the Corps on the revised project cost and implementation as NLLD has framed it up. They are working to finalize the last bits of what they need to express capacity to start the project with funding for the project from Congress. Representatives Steve Scalise and Garret Graves had a meeting with OMB last week. By all accounts, the meeting went very well. NLLD expects to have future meetings with OMB and other departments to garner support around the Morganza. Things are progressing every month, but there needs to be pressure on this issue to get to the goal of federal funding. Morganza to the Gulf (MTG), Reaches K & L and Structures: D. Bourgeois reported the CPRA will be providing $18.2M in funding for the Grand Bayou Flood gate between Reaches K & L in Lafourche Parish. This gate, along with the levees being constructed along Reaches K & L will have a very positive impact on the levees and gravity drainage on the west side of Bayou Lafourche as Grand Bayou is a big source of storm water for those areas. The funding was a joint ask of the state from all three local Levee Districts and a CEA for designated pre and post construction obligations was recently approved and executed by the Districts in August. GIS is the engineering firm for Construction Management. The project will soon go out to bid this year. J. Equipment: Field Coordinator Glenn Bourgeois gave an update on equipment issues during the last month: There were no issues on the MBI buggy. The Theriot Canal Project is finished and they will be moving to 28 Arpent Canal Project in Thibodaux. NLLD rented a long-reach track machine for the Cyprien Discharge Chanel. D. Bourgeois reminded the Board they authorized him to accept the lowest responsive bidder (Quest) last month on the replacement Upper Unit for our Deepwater Buggy. The lowest Apparent Bidder (State Machinery) filed a legal injunction to have a hearing to determine if it was correct for NLLD to deem their bid non responsive. NLLD had discussions and a meeting with State Machinery before the Hearing which was held on February 11 th . The judge ruled that NLLD\ufffds interpretation of the bid package in accordance with Louisiana Contract / Bid Law was correct. The entire process of reaching this conclusion was very professional and cordial. NLLD welcome bids from State Machinery on future equipment. With the injunction lifted, NLLD awarded the contract to Quest. K. General Items \ufffd Items for discussion or information as follows: A.

Held meetings with Fire Officials to clear up and finalize the document March 3, 2020. Huey P. Long Lighting - German American Cultural Center I am still working with LADOTD for direction and approval regarding the roadway lighting design on HPL between 4th and 5th Street. This process will hopefully lead to submitting a design exception/waiver to LADOTD to allow the lighting design on HPL between 4th and 5th street to be based on a roadway classification of Major Collector \ufffd Urban. This is a process that takes time. I have been working on this matter with LADOTD for ~ 2 months now. I cannot complete the HPL roadway lighting design until LADOTD advises how they will classify HPL between 4th and 5th Street. New Lighting between 5th and 6th Street has been awarded to Heritage Electrical. They are currently mobilizing to perform the work. Work has been delayed due to the Mississippi River being at flood stage. The Northern portion of the lighting project near 5th Street is within 1500\ufffd of the levee centerline. The pole foundation excavation depths are 6.5\ufffd so A Corps/SLPFA-W permit and letter of no objection request has been submitted. Contacted Jason Smith with Jefferson Parish and Michael Farabee with Corps to get a quick determination. Still awaiting their decisions. Fifth Street Improvements DOTD is now requiring a pedestrian Study and Historical-Cultural Inventory Study. The fee proposal has been signed and the pedestrian study is starting January 15 when school is fully back in session and other DOTD requirements have been issued. The final preliminary plans will be completed after the findings-requirements from the pedestrian study are finalized. The pedestrian cameras were placed on 5th Street Thursday March 5, 2020. The equipment was picked up Friday March 6, 2020. The study will be completed April 15, 2019. DOTD is completing the 106 research-coordination by reviewing their historical database. It is expected that a \ufffdNo Impact\ufffd letter will be issued by DOTD, stating the project has no detrimental effects to any historical structures in the area. Downtown Drainage Phases 1 & 2 Phase 1: The contractor has begun work. There was a slight modification to the Corps Permit since there are areas being excavated that is greater than 3\ufffd of depth. This permit modification was approved in 48 hours and the project is fully permitted. A buried storage tank was discovered at the work site. It has been drained and the contents are being tested. The Corps of Engineers has been notified that a slight modification to the existing permit may be necessary due to an excavation. The buried storage tank had no adverse chemicals in it and was safely removed. The Corps has released a letter of no objection and the work has resumed. A leaking 8\ufffd waterline was discovered in the project area. Provided to Mike Baudoin three alternatives and costs. Mr. Baudoin\ufffds preference is to repair the 8\ufffd according the current waterline standard materials and offset away from the site so future repairs will not disturb the work that has been completed for Downtown Drainage Phase1. Phase2: 100% Plans-Specifications (Base Bid/Sub Surface Drainage) and cost estimates have been updated-revised for this project. Alternate Plans and Specifications will be completed March 13, 2020. Advertisement for this project is anticipated to be in early April. 25th Street Resiliency Project. Work-Design has begun. Additional funding has been secured to complete the entire 25th Street resiliency Project including 25th street canal improvements and constructing a pump station.

Mayor Belinda C. Constant read the Budget Letter dated March 11, 2020 for the 2020-2021 Budget: Gentlemen of the Council, The City of Gretna ended fiscal year 2018-2019 with a $4.9M unassigned fund balance in the General Fund and a projected fiscal year 2019-2020 unassigned fund balance of $4.5M. The proposed budget document for fiscal year 2020-2021 is presented with a projected current year gain of $1,995. The City of Gretna has experienced modest economic growth as indicated by the recent Standard & Poor\ufffds (S&P) Rating of AA. This along with conservative budgeting has improved the financial posture of the City. This fiscal stability has enabled the City to continue its dedication to improving quality of life and safety throughout the entire City. The City has maintained budgetary flexibility of 37% of operating expenditures while continuing to invest in the police department, public works, and public utilities. The City continues to strengthen the coordination of public and private sector activities for improved economic development outcomes and quality of life. The City is approximately half-way through construction on the $2 million Downtown Drainage Phase 1 project\ufffda transformational project addressing flood mitigation, downtown development, placemaking, and beautification that serves as the keystone project supporting our Gretna Downtown 2020 Plan. The $5.6M Gretna City Park improvements within the Gretna Resilience District and the $2M Downtown Drainage Phase 2 projects are anticipated to begin construction by the end of the 2020 calendar year. We continue to secure significant external funding to support addressing additional longstanding infrastructure needs in the Gretna Resilience District, with an additional $13M in federal and state funds secured in the past year. Improved financial management practices and infrastructure planning efforts were the primary reasons for the City\ufffds significantly improved bond rating of AA this past year. Over the next year, the City will revise its Capital Improvement Program to account for new bond issuance, secured external funds and projects previously completed, assisting our financial decision making around infrastructure maintenance obligations and rehabilitation schedules. Additionally, in June 2019 the City adopted a Unified Development Code to synergize planning and built environment aspirations with a supporting regulatory framework. The City continues to fulfill its long-range planning goals and is witnessing steady improvement in all neighborhoods and commercial corridors. Increasingly, Gretna is identified as a community of choice within the Greater New Orleans Rregion. We must continue to proactively govern and financially plan for a future that solidifies Gretna\ufffds position in order to maintain a competitive living choice that balances a sense of community, affordability and quality of life within the Greater New Orleans Region and the State of Louisiana. The General Fund The General Fund is presented with an increase of $1,995 to the fund balance. Revenues are expected to remain flat. Expenditures are projected based on prior year spending and do not allow for indiscriminate spending or unforeseen costs. A modest performance-based increase in pay is also included for public works and public utility departments. The primary goal in the budget process remains the preservation of the unassigned fund balance which is an indicator of the overall fiscal health of the City of Gretna. The FY 2020-2021 General Fund Budget was only made possible through the collaborative efforts of the Mayor, the Council, Chief of Police, and City of Gretna\ufffds directors and department heads. Additional highlights of the City of Gretna\ufffds Budget are: Garbage Fund Any future increases in the contract cost as a result of the future Consumer Price Index (CPI) calculation will necessitate an evaluation of current garbage fees. Street Lighting Fund The Street Lighting Fund receives revenues through a dedicated millage. Utility repair and maintenance expenditures remain flat. Excess revenues are dedicated to the purchase of additional decorative lighting fixtures needed for the completion of the Downtown Street Lighting Improvement project. Capital Projects The Capital Projects\ufffd budget is included for presentation purposes only. Contracts and Cooperative Endeavor Agreements (CEA) Outside security services provided to Jefferson Parish Courts by the Gretna Police Department will continue and with the passage of this budget, it will authorize the administration to enter into renewal contracts with the various Parish Courts. Additionally, the annual Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) maintenance grass cutting CEA will be authorized with the adoption of this ordinance.

He stated that it?s made up of 3 primary components including the flood gate across Bayou Chene which will have a floating barge gate. He then presented a hand out that shows what the permanent structure will look like. A 400 ft. + long barge on a pivot pile that will swing open and close as need be. He also stated that it takes tremendous efforts to install it on an emergency basis and because it is installed on a temporary basis it has to be removed. He stated that in 2011, the 1st time the St. Mary Levee District was involved, the cost was over $11 million but some of it was left in place therefore, in 2016 the cost was about $7 million and in 2019 the cost was about $5 million. Mr. Matte stated that in each of those cases, there was a FEMA declaration which made it eligible for reimbursement. Since that time, they have passed a parish wide tax that would be used for this project. He proceeded to discuss the permit structure because he has good news to share. He stated that they divided the project into 4 phases. He stated that the Governor has an allocation of $75 million for the project construction. He stated that they previously received an award of $5 million to do the design work which started in 2018 and running through 2019. He stated that they started to break out a few pieces of the project so that they could get started on construction which helps with the timeline and help get that flow of money that was coming from Baton Rouge. Therefore, they did phase 1-A which was clearing at a cost of $400,000. He then stated that phase 1-B is dredging where the new structure will be placed and it will need time to settle before placing material on top of it. He then stated that phase 2 is the most important part of the project and that is the construction of the flood wall and the receiving structure. He then stated that they received bids on that part of the project and the low bid was $23.6 million submitted by Sea Level Construction therefore, an emergency meeting was called and the contract was awarded. He stated that phase 2 is fully funded and the notice to proceed will be issued on April 27, 2020. Mr. Matte stated that because they received a good price for phase 2, they have enough funds to do the floating barge gate, phase 3, which is being advertised now. He then stated that phase 4 is raising the road but the funding for this part is not available but on July 1, 2020 if everything goes through the legislature as intended the funding will be made available. He stated that these funds are GOMESA funds which are federal and have to be spent on coastal projects. He then reviewed the project schedule stating that phase 2 of the construction will begin in mid-April and end July 21, 2021 completing the flood wall. He stated that the barge has fewer construction days than the wall but is expected to be completed by the same date. Mr. Matte then stated that the permit phase introduces questions as to when do they close the barge. He stated that when the river stage gets to 6 they begin notifying people of the closure but it happens when it gets to 7. He added that if they know it will reach 7 they can make the decision to close it as a good steward. He then stated that in order to complete the project they need to make sure they have partnering and an agreement to share the operations and maintenance cost. He stated that they have set a goal of $500,000 a year among all involved for this cost. He then stated that there are some land acquisitions that are not eligible for reimbursement, right of ways, mitigations and project development costs that will need to be shared among all as well. He stated that he?s not requesting an approval tonight but he would like it to be considered so when all components come together the participants are on board and ready to move forward, A brief discussion was then held regarding the information presented, the funds remaining from construction and the project being a federal not state project. Following the discussion, Chairman Irving Comeaux thanked Mr. Matte for the informative presentation.\n\n7. Chairman Irving Comeaux recognized the OHSEP Director, who stated that bids were received for the Cancienne Canal Project. He stated that two (2) bids were received but one of the bids was rejected and returned. He then stated that On Shore Materials, LLC submitted a base bid of $1,208,650, an alternate #1 bid of $817,950 and an alternate #2 bid of $957,900. He then recommended that the bid submitted be accepted. He then stated that due to the budget we are only able to fund the base bid.\n\n8.

Mrs. Gomez informed the Jury that they got started during the flood of last year and Congressman Graves invited them to lunch to discuss funds that were coming that could assist with flooding. She stated that speaking about flooding issues several things were brought up including dredging the waterways because of all the siltation. She stated that following all of their continued discussion they received notification from the Atchafalaya Basin Project stating they wanted to have further discussion. She stated that they submitted a project idea through the Atchafalaya Project to raise some of the roads that are currently serving as levees in our area and for dredging. She then stated that of 13 projects submitted 1 was selected. She added that Congressman Graves has been informing them of where funding can be sought to help with levee protection and that information led them to the Louisiana Watershed Initiative and the Coastal Protection Authority. She stated that they have attended some of those meetings trying to obtain information on what can be done. She stated that they are trying their best to protect the tax base in their area and to continue with tourism. If they don?t try to do something with the largest tax base area the struggle will get bigger. Mrs. Gomez stated that from a real estate prospective, investments are not happening like it once was. She stated that the 2nd homes are now becoming permanent homes for people. She stated that protection is needed on the property values and to sustain businesses. The group is now asking what will the Parish do as the leaders to assist them. Mrs. Gomez stated that they have the potential of getting the grant award for the canoeing/kayaking at Veterans Park and a new museum is coming up which are two tourist opportunities that are being supported by the Chamber of Commerce. They have the Pierre Part/ Belle River Museum Group and the Business Group totaling over 400 people who are also striving to boost tourism and the tax base. She stated that they were informed that Pierre Part is on the radar but somewhat gets blocked. She mentioned that she spoke with Sam Martin to obtain confirmation of what is their problem and he agrees that siltation is the problem. Therefore, they feel that dredging and drainage is what they need and is a good match for the LA Watershed Initiative and if they can pursue along with the Jury to get some of the projects through them they may have a chance to put a handle on flood protection. She added that Bayou L?Ourse and St Mary are well protected but Pierre Part is not. She spoke about the 400 apps that were submitted for the Watershed Initiative funds and stated they are in line with what everyone is having issues with so asking for assistance is the right thing to do. In response, the OHSEP Director stated that an application was submitted and approved for the Cancienne Canal because it met the criteria of being shovel ready with completed engineering plans. He gave the areas in which it drains and explained how the project was broken into phases. He also stated what areas are protected by the Cancienne Canal Project. In response, the OHSEP Director informed that Belle River and Pierre Part Bay are State water bottoms and not a Parish waterway. He explained how the Cancienne Canal is classified a Parish water bottom. In response, Mrs. Gomez stated that they spoke with Kevin Belanger and regardless if the waters or state or parish these waters are what supporst our protection therefore, the OHSEP Director should be able to take the position for the Parish and go after assistance through state funds. In response the OHSEP Director stated that he would direct it to the responsible party of DNR because the State is receiving the majority of the money. He then stated that the steering committee has not met but there is a conference call coming up. Mrs. Gomez stated this is a crisis for them and that the Parish needs a plan so they don?t lose the opportunity of getting funded through the watershed in the next 6-12 years. She added that the Parish, who manages a budget, destroys an area that brings in a large part of the tax base will be hit in one way or another and they don?t? want to see that happen. Following other data presented, Mrs. Gomez suggested that a committee driven by a few Jurors, the OHSEP Director and community members be formed to stay on top of this situation. In response, Juror Ponville stated that he would definitely be on the committee. In response, the OHSEP Director stated that some of the guidance that was received by the steering committee is that as a committee they will represent the 15 parishes in the watershed but they will have to abstain from our own projects. Mr. Kenneth St. Germain mentioned the 1973 flood and stated that it took about 10 years before campers returned to Pierre Part. He then stated that the people will not stand for water problems every year therefore, they just won?t frequent the area. He then stated that during the ?No Wake? period, there was no-one at the camps on the river. In response, Police Juror Irving Comeaux stated that once they put the barge down the water will quit coming and drain. A brief discussion was then held regarding the Bayou Chene Project. Following the discussion, Mrs. Carol Ann Aucoin stated that she and two others have a bed and breakfast on Belle River and only 2 are open due to the back water. She then asked if there is any place in the Jury where those that are a part of state highway can get a little help with raising sections of the road. She stated that she has guests coming in from France and they will be traveling on rough roads. In response, Police Juror Myron Matherne stated he submitted North Belle River road to the state about 3 weeks ago. President Jeff Naquin stated that he passed on the road yesterday and there?s no doubt some attention is needed in that area. Mrs. Carol Ann stated that it?s not feasible nor safe to have anyone travel in 2ft of water. She asked what would be available to the small businesses to keep their doors open because they are closing by the week. A brief discussion was held regarding funding available for assistance. Following the discussion, Mrs. Gomez stated that the Parish will have to get involved heavily through Region 19 to represent them to bring these projects that will do what?s needed and that is to lift the roads. Mr. Seth Breaux stated that the Parish is lucky to have the Volunteer Fire Department because the extended time it?s taking for emergency respondents to arrive or not arrive at a location on a flooded road can mean life or death. Following a brief discussion, President Naquin stated that the Watershed Project funding will be coming with 10 parishes getting the bulk of it but Assumption Parish has opportunity to get some of it. He mentioned the dredging of Lake Verrett as being a great project. Mrs. Carol Ann stated that unless you live there you can?t fathom what it?s like when that water rises. She stated that the sinking of the barge may not help but it took forever for the back water to go away. President Jeff Naquin stated that moving forward the Parish must try to tap into the watershed funding for dredging projects and the only thing that will help the backwater flooding is deeper channels. He then recommended that the Jurors of Wards 7, 8 and 9 join the community members to see that this moves\n13. forward.\n.\n14. President Jeff Naquin recognized the Parish Manager, who requested FMLA leave for the Maintenance Supervisor, Brain Blankenship, who will be the care giver for 3 weeks.\n\n15.
