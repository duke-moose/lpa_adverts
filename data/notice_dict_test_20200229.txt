A preconstruction meeting was held at the NLLD office on January 8th and the Notice to Proceed was issued for March 2nd to allow them time for the delivery of the sheet pile for the project. C. Lockport - Larose Project Area Lockport \ufffd Larose Valentine Return Levee Project: Project Manager Arthur Ostheimer reported the contractor Low Land Low Land, Angelette Picciola, and the NLLD held a construction progress meeting onsite on January 22nd to review the project status. Low Land has moved a majority of the material across the canal and is about one lift away from finishing the levee. NLLD has asked them to move any remaining borrow to the levee side to allow NLLD to perform some maintenance work at a later date on the levee. The remaining item is removing the plug across the canal which NLLD expects to be completed in the next two to three weeks. Once the plug is removed, this forced drainage system will be fully open from the Claudet Return to the Intercoastal Canal. Neil with Angelette Picciola has a recommendation for a change order to add some contract time due to weather and adverse conditions for the Board\ufffds consideration. A motion was made by A. Peltier, seconded by S. Bergeron to approve a change order to extend the construction period by 53 days to February 12, 2020 due to 42 days for rain/weather delays and 11 days for additional construction time as requested by Low Land Construction Company, Inc. and recommended by the project engineer. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. Lockport \ufffd Larose Levee Project Reaches C4, C5, and D1: Director Bourgeois reported Onshore Materials, LLC is the contractor on this project that is phase 1 and 2 of the improvements to the levees in these reaches. Project Manager Ostheimer reported Onshore is continuing to excavate. They have the section they are currently excavating along with one additional section to finish in order to complete the excavation portion of the project. They slowed a bit around the holidays but have been back excavating the section. NLLD is expecting them to complete the excavating in the next four to six weeks. Parr/Larose Pump Station 30\ufffd Pump Addition and Canal Debris Screen: Director Dwayne Bourgeois reported Crosby Dredging is the contractor on this project that involves the removal of the old structure at Barrios, the addition of a pump and a debris screen at the new Lafourche Parish Government pump station. Project Manager Arthur Ostheimer reported Crosby Dredging has completed the demolition of the old Barrios station, installed the trash screen across the canal at the Parr/Larose pump, and demolished the old Edna pump station. They have installed a majority of the embankment to fix the alignment of the levee where the old Barrios station was and should complete this work in the next couple of weeks. After that, Crosby will be waiting for the pumps to be delivered for installation in the Parr/Larose pump station. Lockport to Larose Reach B Levee Project: Director Dwayne Bourgeois reported Picciola & Associates continues to develop alternatives to the preliminary design and budgets for the proposed three phases of this levee reach. NLLD feels confident in being able to return with some projects that can be pushed forward likely in a future budget. Project Manager Ostheimer reported NLLD met with Picciola on January 7th to discuss the project. Picciola was able to identify a couple of landowners willing to work with NLLD for access and plan on meeting with one of them on January 29th to try and iron out the details. A more immediate issue came up this month which was water feeding into the system through a culvert in the levee. The culvert was installed by Lafourche Parish Government (LPG) and has degraded to a point that water is flowing around the pipe and the gate has fallen off. This was an issue due to water feeding into the system in a roundabout way from a small breach in the Bayou Le\ufffdBleu levee. The NLLD is working with LPG to install a new pipe consistent with NLLD plans for the levee improvement along with a new gate so that if needed the pipe can be closed and prevent water from entering the pump system. Picciola is working with the NLLD and LPG to get this work done ASAP. Comeaux Drive Drainage Project: Director Bourgeois reported the Town of Lockport had the drainage corridor right of ways cleared and the system was inspected from the inside. NLLD had another meeting on January 10th with the Mayor, the Town Clerk and their Engineer along with Leonard Chauvin P.E., Inc. (LCI) to go over the work phases that would be required for the work north and south of LA1, what has been completed by the Town, what NLLD has done so far, the cost of all of that, future cost, etc. NLLD is engaging LCI to advance the design and ROW requirements on this so that NLLD can help the Town pursue funding during the coming year. NLLD also plans to bring the Parish and LP DD#1 into the search for funding. So, NLLD still has a bit more to consider before asking the board to consider the request for funding assistance made by the Town of Lockport for that purpose. C. Kief asked to place a price on the whole project. D. Bourgeois said NLLD is in the process of doing that. The NLLD is also being a technical supportive role in order for Lafourche Parish and the Town of Lockport to get funding/grants. D. Choupic Project Area There was nothing to report for this Project Area at this time. E. St. James Project Area Director Bourgeois reported NLLD is developing items in the Project Area via this drainage study by Duplantis Design Group (DDG). To remind everyone, the overall plan here is to allow Thibodaux to develop this area in a proactive, forward looking way; to avoid trying to correct for unplanned difficult drainage issues in the future. Project Manager Arthur Ostheimer reported DDG is creating a hydraulic model for this area. It will take several months to gather the input information. All the equipment is set up, basically now what\ufffds needed is to measure the real conditions during rainfall events. F. Lake Bouef Watershed Project Area Zeller/Larousse Forced Drainage Area Systems Improvements: Director Bourgeois reported Sealevel Construction completed the work in 2018 on Phase 1A of this project which included clearing encroachments and dredging the reservoir. NLLD is working on the development of Phase 2 of this project with the intent to make further improvements in elevation and stability of this levee. Project Manager Arthur Ostheimer reported NLLD received a favorable geotechnical report which means the levee will be able to be improved within the existing footprint and avoid the need to permit and mitigate prior to construction. Leonard Chauvin P.E., Inc. is continuing to work on the design of the project with plans to be ready for construction by the end of the year for this phase of the project. 40 and 80 Arpent and Halpins Canal Maintenance Dredging Project, East Theriot Canal Maintenance Dredging Project, and Sam Foret and adjacent Canals Maintenance Dredging: Director Bourgeois reported Sealevel Construction is the contractor for the hydraulic spray dredging of these canals and adjacent canals combined. Project Manager Arthur Ostheimer reported Sealevel is currently dredging the 80 Arpent Canal toward Raceland Sugars. Overall, they are about 67% complete with the overall dredging of the project. Based on a request by the NLLD, Leonard Chauvin P.E., Inc. (LCI) has been able to include additional canals for dredging since NLLD had advantageous pricing for the project. A motion was made by L. Andolsek, seconded by A. Peliter to approve a change order to extend the construction period to April 23, 2020 due to 85 days for additional construction time and a net increase of $99,712.00 as requested by Sealevel Construction, Inc. and recommended by the project engineer for additional work. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. Another motion was made by R. Pitre, seconded by T. Allen to approve payment of a pay request in the amount of $51,494.75 from Sealevel Construction, Inc. as recommended by the project engineer. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. G. Gheens Project Area Mathews Canal/Clotilda Levee Improvements Project: Director Bourgeois reported NLLD is just waiting for the sloughed area to settle as reported last month. GIS will perform surveys of the cross sections to record the settlement in the area. Des Allemands Bulkhead Project: Director Bourgeois reported All South Consulting Engineers (ASCE) is monitoring the small sloughing area. Project Manager Arthur Ostheimer Outer Limits installed additional material onto the levee. Once this material was installed there was some additional settlement as might be expected. ASCE and the NLLD went out to review and both feel all is still good. Once material dries, NLLD and ASCE will have Outer Limits install some additional material to continue to work towards completing the levee to section, probably toward the end of March or April. Des Allemands FDA Pump Improvement Project: Director Bourgeois reported Sealevel Construction Inc. is the contractor on this project that has GOMESA funds committed and includes the construction of a new pump station in Des Allemands and the removal of the existing pump station. Project Manager Arthur Ostheimer reported the Notice to Proceed was issued for January 6th. The NLLD, Sealevel and All South Consulting Engineers met onsite with Entergy. In order to begin construction service lines that pass over the station need to be rerouted which was known through bidding. Entergy has been paid for the relocation work which is a requirement prior to a work order being issued. NLLD is currently waiting to hear from Entergy on when the work will take place. Sealevel currently has the pumps ordered and are procuring materials in expectation to begin work in the next couple of weeks. Jesse Dufrene FDA Levee Improvements: Director Bourgeois reported Onshore Materials, LLC is the contractor for this project which has GOMESA funding committed through CPRA and designed to raise four miles of levee height from +4\ufffd to +7\ufffd. Project Manager A. Ostheimer reported Onshore has backfilled approximately 1,000 LF of the force drainage canal which is part of the design to gain stability of the levee. This work is time consuming as there is a period this material has to sit prior to excavating the final channel section. E. Pitre made a motion, seconded by S. Bergeron, to approve Change Order No. 2 to extend the construction period to October 22, 2020 due to 65 days for additional construction time due to rain days as requested by Onshore Materials, LLC and recommended by the project engineer. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. A motion was made by R. Pitre, seconded by P. Gasery to approve payment of a pay request in the amount of $78,325.36 from Onshore Materials, LLC as recommended by the project engineer. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. Natural Gas FDA Levee Improvements: Director Bourgeois reported the other half of the protection for the Gheens Community is the Natural Gas FDA. NLLD wants to have this project framed up because, like Jessie Dufrene, it is a prime candidate for GOMESA funds, should they become available. Project Manager A. Ostheimer reported All South Consulting Engineers (ASCE) is working on the final design for this project with a plan of bidding the project out later this year, most likely in the early summer. ASCE met with landowners this month in order to work out some access points for the project. Upper Barataria Risk Reduction (UBRRP) Project: Director Bourgeois reported this project is included in the State\ufffds Master Plan for 2017 and the project team has spent some time working with the CPRA on project details to help shape the action for the Corps\ufffd new start design funding. NLLD wants to be able to be sure that the Corps\ufffd efforts blend in well with the design team and the efforts of CPRA. The Corps has released its draft report on their study of the project. Further, the NLLD and the LBLD have been working cooperatively to get this design further down the road. C. Kief asked if this project qualifies for federal grant opportunities. D. Bourgeois said yes it does and he is working with St. Charles parish on another coalition similar to MAC in order to assist in those funding opportunities. A motion was made by E. Pitre, seconded by D. Kiffe to deviate from the agenda to discuss Mr. Ray Cheramie\ufffds questions and concerns. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. Lockport \ufffd Larose Levee Projects- Concerns of Mr. Ray Cheramie: Sponsored by Commissioner Darcy Kiffe: Director Dwayne Bourgeois reported that as allowed by NLLD By-Laws (Article 7.6 (a)), Mr. Ray Cheramie approached Commissioner Darcy Kiffe and asked for a few items to be added to the agenda. Commissioner Darcy Kiffe agreed to sponsor his request. As such, D. Bourgeois addressed each of these questions / Comments. They are as follows: (1)- Rules and or Regulations on trafficking on the Protection Levee; (2)- Rules and or Regulations on trafficking in the reservoir. D. Bourgeois answered concerns and questions 1-2 by stating the only way activity is allowed on levees and reservoirs by a landowner on private property is through a permit process with the levee district and the state. If there is any trespassing activity on the property the landowner does not approve of, he or she would have to call law enforcement. The NLLD would call the law if noticing a trespasser damaging the levee and reservoir property. The NLLD Board agrees with Mr. Ray Cheramie that trespassing is an issue and can cause possible damage to the levees and reservoirs. However, the Board also suggested that there are laws already enacted to avert these issues. Discussion ensued about resolving trespassing issues and who should regulate the canal and if NLLD should do more to patrol the reservoir, or if there needs to be an ordinance on motor vehicles. R. Pitre made a motion, seconded by E. Pitre to approve North Lafourche Levee District Attorney Pat Amedee to research the South Lafourche Levee District\ufffds regulations for patrolling its levees and canals and to study other local ordinances that would restrict certain transportation, actions and trespassing in the 40/80 Arpent canal for possible adoption by the North Lafourche Levee District at a future meeting. On call for discussion, D. Bourgeois asked Commissioners L. Andolsek and T. Allen for their opinions since they have experience with this. L. Andolsek and T. Allen both agree that it is the landowner\ufffds responsibility to notify the police of trespassing on his/her own property and in the Right of Way agreements, the landowner is protected from lawsuits when needed, but they do agree with doing more research as in the motion. No further discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. Mr. Ray Cheramie asked at what elevation is the reservoir going to be kept and who will patrol and enforce these rules and regulations? D. Bourgeois said the reservoir levels are regulated by Lafourche Parish and explained the pump station monitoring system that will monitor the reservoir from getting too low in order to prevent damaging the reservoir. Lastly, Mr. Ray Cheramie asked when is the dam across the pump reservoir behind Phillip Plaisance\ufffds property going to be removed. D. Bourgeois said the dam will be removed in 2-3 weeks. T. Allen made a motion, seconded by S. Bergeron to return to the regular agenda. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. H. Valentine - East Project Area New Valentine/Ludevine FDA: Director Bourgeois reported this this levee running from Hamilton St. in Larose about 5,500 feet towards the Ludevine Pump Station along the Blackwater Canal needs to be stabilized. Picciola & Associates is working on the final design and the bid package. This project was previously approved for advancement through the bid process and authorization of expropriation on the one remaining tract, if necessary. Project Manager A. Ostheimer reported NLLD had one RoW remaining for the project which the Board had approved expropriation as a last resort. The NLLD and Picciola continued to work with the landowner and he has agreed to voluntarily sell the RoW for the project which is scheduled for Wednesday. With the right of way issues being resolved NLLD has moved forward with the project and begun the advertisement today with the expectation of receiving bids on March 3rd so that NLLD will have a recommendation for award at our March Board meeting. Morgana to the Gulf Eastern Tie-in, Reach 2 Interim Improvements: Project Manager Arthur Ostheimer reported NLLD had mentioned last month NLLD engaged GIS to begin working on a project within the existing footprint that would improve the levee by stabilizing and increasing the elevation in some areas. NLLD\ufffds approach is going to be similar to the work in Gheens. The NLLD identified this particular Reach as one that has significant variation in elevation from approximately 3\ufffd to 6\ufffd. Currently, GIS is performing the topographic survey for the levee and has the geotechnical work scheduled to begin in the next couple of weeks. Just for reference this levee work would begin where the T-Bois levee project ends. I. Regional/Other Capital Projects Pump Station Study: Director D. Bourgeois reported this project is extending NLLD\ufffds influence into the proper operation of the pumps in Lafourche Parish to prevent possible damage from over pumping and the educational step is complete. Project Manager A. Ostheimer reported T. Baker Smith submitted four reports this month and is scheduled to deliver the final reports in the next two to three weeks. Once completed, NLLD will begin review of the current pump off elevation compared to the recommended so that NLLD can discuss with LPG. Morganza to the Gulf (MTG), Larose to Lockport Feasibility Report: Director Bourgeois reported Mitch Marmande with Delta Coast Consultants (DCC) is working on the design of the actual alignment of the levee within the North Lafourche District and to file the permit application. Project Manager A. Ostheimer reported DCC had previously submitted the permit application for Reach 4 and we are continuing to monitor and provide information as needed. DCC and NLLD had been working with a pipeline company regarding a conflict which has been settled. The pipeline shifted over so DCC is working on finalizing the permit application for Reach 1. Morganza to the Gulf: Director Bourgeois reported NLLD is working on a sustained new push in an attempt to find funding for the federally authorized Morganza to the Gulf Project which now comes well into the jurisdiction of the NLLD. This push includes a re-evaluation of their estimated cost of the project. NLLD has been working at all levels of the Corps, Louisiana Delegation in DC, State legislators and others in this effort. The report generated from the Study was very favorable in that it demonstrated that the Corps could build out this system to a 1% AEP LORR to the year 2035 at a cost of $3.2B as compared to the prior PACR estimate of > $10.6B (>$15B today). The report has moved from the District, through Division and is now through HQ and the ASA-CW. So, lots of positive movement there. At this point, the regional levee districts have buy-in from the Corps on the revised project cost and implementation as it\ufffds framed up at all levels of the Corps. They are working to finalize the last bits of what they need to express capacity to start the project with funding for the project from Congress. NLLD Director along with Cory, Michael Henry (representing MAC) and a few others from LA representatives met with OMB last week in DC. By all accounts the meeting went very well. Everyone expects additional meetings with OMB will be necessary and LA Delegation is working on that. Things are progressing, but everyone needs to keep pressure on this issue to get to the goal of federal funding. Morganza to the Gulf (MTG), Reaches K & L and Structures: Director D. Bourgeois reported the CPRA will be providing $18.2M in funding for the Grand Bayou Flood gate between Reaches K & L in Lafourche Parish. This gate, along with the levees being constructed along Reaches K & L will have a very positive impact on the levees and gravity drainage on the west side of Bayou Lafourche as Grand Bayou is a big source of storm water for those areas. The funding was a joint ask of the state from all three local Levee Districts and a CEA for designated pre and post construction obligations was recently approved and executed by the Districts in August. GIS was approved for the Construction Management. The project will soon go out to bid this year. More on that as moving forward. J. Equipment: Field Coordinator Glenn Bourgeois gave an update on equipment issues during the last month: A main drive shaft broke on the MBI buggy. They repaired it but it did not last. They built a new one and replaced it. The other shaft broke and by tomorrow or Thursday, they should be coming to replace it and should be working by the end of next week. Discussion ensued on the buy-back on the machine. NLLD did a PM service on the machine while it was down. Award of new Excavator Upper Unit for placement on Wilco pontoons: As reported last month, advertisement was in place for bids to be received and publicly opened. An addendum was issued and the bid opening was moved to Tuesday, January 21, 2020. We received two bids both below budget of $350K. The first bid was for a Hyundai Machine from State Machinery for $266,279.80 and a second bid was for a Link-Belt Machine from Quest machinery for $299,487.00. (a difference of $33,207.20). NLLD produced these bid documents and specifications in-house. NLLD does not feel like the lowest bidder was not the lowest responsive bidder. NLLD worked these questions in consultation with NLLD attorney Pat Amedee and Leonard Chauvin who has prepared and evaluated machinery specifications / bids for NLLD in the past. A motion was made by R. Pitre, seconded by A. Peltier to authorize the Executive Director to issue a Notice of Award in the amount of $ 299,487 to Quest Construction Equipment, LLC to furnish and deliver a new Excavator, make and model Link Belt 350 X4 LF Upper Unit as detailed in the bid documents, allowing the Executive Director to sign all necessary documents for the purchase. T. Allen asked if the NLLD is prepared to give reason for not awarding the lowest bidder. Attorney Pat Amedee explained that State Machinery did not supply details on their proposed machine to the NLLD with the bid package so that the NLLD could determine if their proposed machine met the bid requirements. No further discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. K. General Items \ufffd Items for discussion or information as follows: Project Manager Arthur Ostheimer presented photos and gave explanations on the following projects: LtoL C4, C5, D1; TLBB Element 2 Coastal to Twin Oaks Phase 1 and Phase 2; Gheens-Jesse Dufrene FDA Improvements; Edna/Barrios Pump Station; C4 Tie-in (back of Valentine Return Levee). Open Meetings Seminar: The Lafourche Parish District Attorney\ufffds Office will host an Open Meetings Seminar for all parish board and commission members on Wednesday, March 4 at 6:00 p.m. at the Lafourche Parish Government Complex in Mathews. The topics covered will be: Open Meeting/Executive Session, Public Record and Public Bid. D. Bourgeois, along with Arthur, Madonna, Glenn and Katie will attend. NLLD would like to encourage the Board to attend as well. NFIP Reform & Reauthorization Effort with CPRA via the LFRC: Director Bourgeois reported he and Executive Assistant Katie DeRoche along with CPRA made a trip in December 10-12 to continue the efforts of pushing for an NFIP reauthorization/changes to the program before the end of this year. The entire NFIP was set to expire on December 31, 2019 along with the rest of the Federal Government. However, a Continuing Resolution was approved that extends the operation of the Government (along with the NFIP) until September 30th 2020. NLLD has provided the board with a meeting summary for each of these trips. This process is working out very well and is most helpful with the efforts. Although the NFIP is extended Until Sep. 30, 2020 within the CR, NLLD still feels there is more work to be done on obtaining a long-term extension. NLLD has a meeting with CPRA later this week to work on a strategy for this year. Other Meetings this Month: Director Bourgeois stated in addition to the regular monthly meeting circuit and those previously discussed, he participated in the following meetings: CPRA/NFIP Subcommittee Meeting: 12/18/19 CPRA 2021 Draft Annual Plan Public Comment: 1/7/2020 SCIA Luncheon: 1/14/2020 BIG Luncheon: 1/16/2020 DC Mardi Gras/Legislative Meetings: 1/21/2020-1/24/2020 Finance & Priority Committee: Commissioner K. Matherne reported that the Finance and Priority Committee met on December 17, 2019. The NLLD Board has a copy of those minutes in tonight\ufffds meeting packet. During that meeting, the committee reviewed and approved the Payables report that was recommended and accepted for approval by the full board during the Regular Board meeting that followed. At that same meeting, the F&P committee reviewed the Proposed 2020 Budget prior to recommendation of adoption to the full board. Accounts Payable: In the meeting packets, the commissioners were provided with a financial report detailing the 2019 year-to-date figures, as well as the current month\ufffds Accounts Payable listing. The chairman of the Finance & Priority was asked for the committee\ufffds recommendation. A motion was made by K. Matherne, seconded by E. Pitre to accept the Payables Report as given. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. The Board President called for other engineering reports; there were none. The Board President called for additional public comments; there were none. The Board President announced the next Regular Monthly Board Meeting will be at 5:30 PM, or immediately following the 5:15 PM F&P committee meeting, on Tuesday, February 18, 2020 at the District\ufffds office located at 3862 Highway 1, Raceland, LA.

They are in the process of purchasing materials, blasting and painting sheet piles, and should be on site later this month. Melancon questioned the cost of both projects which Davie Breaux, Deputy Port Director replied the 400\ufffd Bulkhead project is $2,585,000 with $2,327,000 funded by DOTD and the 1100\ufffd Bulkhead project is $6,539,000 with $5,885,000 funded by DOTD. Engineer Larry Picciola reported Minor Cheramie Sr. Road Paving project is complete with the clear lien certificate from Byron E. Talbot Contractors on the agenda for approval. Thad Angelloz reported on the Coastal Wetlands Park stating the view finders have arrived which was purchased from a grant with LA Cajun Bayou. The plan is to put 2 at the Public Boat Launch and the other 2 in the wetlands park. We will construct the platforms and have an event sometime in the spring. He stated we are working through the second submittal of the Land & Water Conservation grant which is due in April. Airport Projects \ufffd Joe Wheeler, Airport Manager presented to the board the Louisiana Airports Economic Impact Update. He stated back in 2015 they began this study as part of the statewide system of airports. In 2015 our airport had employment of 346, base aircraft of 31, annual operations of 13,560, and the economic output of $57.2M per year. In 2019 the airport has employment of 529, base aircraft of 54, annual operations of 27,078, and the economic output of $97.6M. Wheeler stated in 4 years the economic output increased by $40M. He stated out of all 70 airports in the state, we are ranked 9th overall including commercial airports by the economic output. He stated from the 62 general aviation airports, we are ranked 4th. He reported the aircraft operations for the month of December were 1,743, with 9,115 passengers, and 17,404 vehicles. The yearly totals are 27,078 operations, 124,242 passengers, and 211,136 vehicles. The Airfield Drainage Improvements project is complete and the final inspection with Byron E. Talbot Contractors is scheduled for January 15th at 2PM. There is a change order for an additional 14 days due to weather delays. Engineer Joe Picciola reported on the Airport Connector Road and Bridge project. The 30% design plans were submitted in October and we did receive comments back from DOTD. He stated this week we submitted the right of way plats and have already received some comments back which we are having a conference call tomorrow morning to discuss legalities and detailed plats. We have applied for the State permit, Corps permit, and Coast Guard permits and are in different phases of the process for each. We did have public meetings December 12th and December 19th to introduce the project to the public. We had a lot of participation with good questions and was able to answer their questions and concerns. The next deadline we are working toward is the 60% design set submittal which is due by the end of March. Other Projects \ufffd David Bastian with GIS Engineering reported on the Section 203 Feasibility Study. We know it is a good project we just need to convince Washington it is a good project. We recently worked on the modifications to comply with Washington\ufffds rules. The feasibility report complies with the Corp of Engineer\ufffds criteria so we can convince them we have a feasible project. He stated we are now working on the report that we plan to send off to Washington in the next few days for them to review again. Executive Director Chett Chiasson stated we have been working on this report for several years and where we are at today is finalizing the addendum to the report answering all questions and concerns that the Assistant Secretary of the Army Corps had from the initial submittal. We are at the final stage for GIS Engineering to submit the addendum by the end of this week. He stated the goal is the 50\ufffd draft in Fourchon for the Fourchon Island Development. From discussions with the Corps, it is imperative that we move forward in the next WRDA bill to get some approval for the 30\ufffd draft, now which will allow us to start dredging sooner than we thought. Then we will move forward with the 50\ufffd by proving to the Corps and the ASA that 50\ufffd is feasible and justifiable. All the economics show it is, so for us to move forward we will get the 30\ufffd approved while we work to get the rest approved later. Davie Breaux reported on the Highway Embankment Stabilization work. He stated there was a section along LA 308 near 74th Street in Cut Off where we placed rock to protect the embankment from scouring. We are now working to recap along LA 1 south of the floodgates in different areas where water and debris crosses the road during storms or high tides. R. Gisclair Sr. stated he received a few phone calls from property owners thanking the Port for doing this work. Update on Port Communications and Social Media \ufffd Thad Angelloz presented a recap of 2019 social media growth across all platforms. Facebook added 4,000 followers a 72% growth, Twitter added 360 followers a 51% growth, Instagram added 246 followers a 116% growth, and we also began a YouTube channel with 154 subscribers. The next slide presented a comparison of the Port\ufffds Facebook page compared to others in the gulf south. He stated we were behind several of the other ports at the beginning of 2019, however he is happy to report we now have the most followers of anyone in the gulf south. We are also actually in front of larger ports such as Port of Tacoma and Port of Seattle. We are only 400 followers behind the Port of New York and New Jersey. When we combine that with other efforts, we have communicated to the general public one example is with Hurricane Barry. Angelloz stated he did a lot of work with the Lafourche Parish Sheriff\ufffds office and we became a community leader regarding getting information out. There are a lot of efforts that are unseen through these types of events. He stated just through Facebook messenger he received over 100 messages from people with questions or concerns, or just thanks. This is very rewarding and something we should always be on the forefront in doing by answering questions from the general public and giving them important information. He stated through the storm event we reached over a quarter million people. As we move forward into this year, we have a quarterly newsletter we will be launching. It will include a state of the port address by Chett, it will have a project spotlight, commissioner spotlight, and a tenant spotlight. We hope to have that out within the next couple of days and will be sending to everyone that subscribes to us. To summarize we are very pleased with the growth we have seen in 2019. We are heading into our 60th year anniversary and will be rolling out a lot of different things of who we are and what we do. Look forward to seeing this growth moving forward. Chiasson stated the point of the presentation is to inform the public of all the different platforms we are on and highlight the information that we continue to put out for the public. Presentation by Energy World on the Fourchon LNG Project \ufffd Graham Elliot reported the Port Fourchon LNG facility will be built in 2 phases. The first phase is to build one storage tank of 2 million tons per annum for LNG production with an investment of $888M and 300 full time direct employees, with indirect employment of 1,500. The LNG Fourchon facility will be primarily used for their own pump terminals as they are developing LNG import facilities in the Caribbean, Asia, and the Philippines and power generation assets to utilize this as a clean fuel for the rest of the world. They are still committed to develop the project site in Port Fourchon and feel this is the best location of anywhere off the gulf coast. We are in close connection to a gas pipeline and a kinetica pipeline to secure use of to bring in gas. Regarding the power supply because the development is an electric LNG modular facility there have been discussions with Entergy on whether they would bring power supply to the project on commercial terms or whether we would develop a power supply on site. Commercially it turns out better that we develop the power supply and, in the future, we may have power supply available for the region. Again, we will employ 300 directly and 1500 indirectly. We do have a business philosophy to try and employ locally first from the community. Energy World does support Buy American products. He stated that even in developing the receiving terminals in the Philippines the gas and steam turbines and generating equipment are manufactured in the USA. They are using USA manufactured equipment. In Indonesia, they are using all CHART manufactured equipment which comes from New Iberia. The project team consists of Royal Engineering, Port Commission, Gexcon, FTT, Fugro, TRC, Hogan Lovells, JS Held, Kinetica Partners, Providence, Entergy, Jones Walker, and MITAGS-PMI. Some project milestones for Fourchon LNG that have been completed are all open houses and all prefiling documentation for FERC with the exception of reports 11 and 13 which are expected to be submitted by the end of January. Then there will be a commenting period of 4 months or so. We are aiming to get out of the FERC process by the first quarter of next year to start construction soon thereafter. There is also the Corps permit that may take longer. In summary, the project management team is in place, EPC Contractor has been selected, detailed engineering and resource submissions have been done. Projected Construction Phase I to begin mid-2021 with commercial operations by mid-2023. We developed in 2 phases because the first phase does not require the dredging to happen. If the Port does get to the deeper depths, we will push on to Phase 2. We are developing in Jamaica LNG Hub terminal and in the Philippines close to completion of the import terminals, which will become the consumer of our LNG. He then discussed the benefits of LNG from the Philippines Department of Energy proving LNG is the lowest cost per fuel for power, environmentally friendly replacing coal, and the most economic source of power for people. The market reaching to develop 7,000 megawatts to develop 7M tons for Fourchon. They are also working with GTT and various shipyards overseas to develop small scale shallow draft LNG tankers to shuffle to the Caribbean or other markets. President Cheramie opened the floor for public comment. Chiasson recognized in the audience some Harbor Police officers with promotions Tait Lafont and Brook Angelette were promoted to Sergeants. There have been other transfers from road officers to marine patrol and we are now in the next phase to hire 4 new Harbor Police officers. We have made an offer to 1 and there are 3 others coming in for interviews in the upcoming weeks. Chief Mike Kinler thanked the board for their support to move forward with this department expansion. Chiasson then recognized Senator Mike Fesi, Representative Reggie Bagala, Representative Bryan Fontenot, Lafourche Parish President Archie Chaisson, Parish Council D\ufffdLynn Boudreaux and Daniel Lorraine. Chiasson then presented a plaque to the outgoing Senator Norby Chabert who has been very supportive to us for the past 12 years or more. Chiasson then read the plaque \ufffdIn appreciation for your years of dedicated service and leadership on behalf of Port Fourchon and the South Lafourche Leonard Miller, Jr. Airport\ufffd. Senator Chabert then addressed the board stating he appreciates this and when you see your public service mortality in front of you some ask what\ufffds next and if you will miss it. He stated he will follow the path the Lord puts him on, and if he\ufffdll miss it, he stated it\ufffds like a football coach speech on accomplishments and wins. It is the losses that stick with them. He stated in his line of work if you do it the right way you try to accomplish as much as you can in the era of term limits and if you are successful this day will come. In looking back on what you accomplished and were not able to, one of his first meetings with Ted and, also the first meeting he had with Chett was what the deepening of the channel meant to the economics of the Port, the region, and the possibilities that would come after. It was a different time in the market. Oil was better than today. What was surprising was how little the state understood what an energy port was, since other ports in the region were tonnage ports, import and exports different from what we do here. But when you showed them the numbers and have a vison for the future, they supported it. He stated that even though we are not quite there yet, it is exciting to know that 30\ufffd is on the horizon and 50\ufffd will come soon after. One of the accomplishments he is proud of is writing of the Port Infrastructure Tax Credit, when Governor Jindal came here to sign it into law it was a big deal with working with the Port and L.E.D. We wrote the tightest written tax credit in the State of Louisiana which was first awarded to the Bollinger facility built in Port Fourchon. It will now be the job of Senator Fesi who will do an excellent job for this organization to accomplish the need for the state\ufffds support of the bridge for the airport expansion. The airport numbers are remarkable, and it took a lot from the Port years ago to get in that arena. He appreciates the opportunity to work with the board and serve the public. Chiasson thanked him and it has been an honor to work Senator Chabert on some monumental legislation. He learned a lot on how it all works. We are looking forward to working with Senator Fesi, Senator Fontenot, Representative Bagala and Parish President Chaisson to continue to do the work this board has done for the community.

Thibodaux \ufffd West Project Area: Director Dwayne Bourgeois reported NLLD is developing items in the Project Area by extending this drainage study with additional investigations to assist the City of Thibodaux and the Parish with a proactive approach for drainage since this area is seeing a tremendous surge in development. Waverly No. 2 Channel Project: Director D. Bourgeois stated NLLD is in the process of developing a potential NLLD project that would create a new major drainage channel functionally parallel to and complimentary to the existing Waverly Ditch that NLLD is calling the Waverly No. 2 Channel Project. Design and estimates are still in the works in order to run the NOPET evaluation to determine advancement eligibility. NLLD came to an agreement with the first landowner and working on the right of way agreement. DDG gave the NLLD a list of landowners and area calculations for the remaining right of ways needed. The next step will be to enter the information in NOPET and see where it leads. NSU Drainage Study: Director D. Bourgeois reported that Nicholls State University has long persisting drainage issues and they have reached out to NLLD for assistance to address these issues on campus and the surrounding areas. The NLLD has DDG performing a drainage study to review all aspects of the Nicholls\ufffd campus. DDG has started the survey work and NLLD should have more information over the next couple of months. B. Thibodaux - Lockport - Bayou Blue Project Area Bayou Blue \ufffd Hollywood Backwater Flood Protection Project: Director D. Bourgeois reported the State\ufffds Annual Plan includes future funding expected from GOMESA funds for engineering and construction. Leonard Chauvin P.E., Inc. (LCI) has submitted the permit application. NLLD is continuing to monitor the progress. LCI is continuing with the design and NLLD plans on having the final design ready to go upon receipt of the permit. TLBB Element 2, (Lockport to Mathews Levee Improvements Project): Director D. Bourgeois reported Sealevel is the contractor on Phase I which covers the area requiring sheet pile installation. The Lemoine Company, LLC is the contractor on Phase II which is the canal relocation and berm construction. These phases are both included in an IGA with CPRA for GOMESA funds reimbursement. For Phase I, Sealevel is currently installing the sheet pile for the project. They have installed approximately 2400 LF of sheet pile with about 500-600 LF remaining. NLLD expects Sealevel to finish in January. A motion was made by R. Pitre, seconded by K. Matherne to approve payment of a pay request in the amount of $711,745.05 from Sealevel Construction, Inc. as recommended by the project engineer. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. For Phase II, The Lemoine Company is continuing to clear the right of way and is beginning excavation of the new borrow canal. Cyprien FDA Channel Improvements: Director Dwayne Bourgeois reported Entergy has removed the electrical lines that were blocking access to the discharge channel. Field Coordinator Glenn Bourgeois is now working on a plan to get the canal excavated based on the recommendation from T. Baker Smith and that should start at the beginning of the year. US90 at Bayou Folse: Director Dwayne Bourgeois reported this project is another one with a commitment from CPRA for GOMESA funding. Their commitment is allowing the District to design and construct a permanent solution to raise the elevation of the levee adjacent to the US Hwy 90 Bridge over Bayou Folse on both sides. NLLD has finalized all the right of ways for the project. NLLD is still waiting for concurrence from CPRA and for DOTD to issue the permit for the project. Leonard Chauvin P.E., Inc. has finalized the bidding documents for the project and expects to begin advertising when receiving concurrence. Crest Pump Stabilization: Director Dwayne Bourgeois reported that Crosby Dredging, LLC is the contractor on this project as awarded last month. NLLD is finalizing the construction contract. Once NLLD has the contracts complete, Leonard Chauvin P.E., Inc. will schedule the pre-construction meeting. C. Lockport - Larose Project Area Lockport \ufffd Larose Valentine Return Levee Project: Director Dwayne Bourgeois reported Low Land Construction is the contractor on the levee portion of this project. Low Land is continuing to place material along the new alignment of C4. Lockport \ufffd Larose Levee Project Reaches C4, C5, and D1: Director Dwayne Bourgeois reported Onshore Materials, LLC is the contractor on this project that is phase 1 and 2 of the improvements to the levees in these reaches. Onshore is continuing to excavate the new channel and fill the existing channel. They have moved down and will have one section remaining once this area is complete. The section is approximately 2000 LF. NLLD expects Onshore to finish the original contract work around the end of January. Once this work is complete, they will move back to the beginning of the project to begin putting the levee into section. Parr/Larose Pump Station 30\ufffd Pump Addition and Canal Debris Screen: Director Dwayne Bourgeois reported Crosby Dredging is the contractor on this project that involves the removal of the old structure at Barrios, the addition of a pump and a debris screen at the new LPG pump station. Crosby Dredging has completed the demolition of the old Barrios station and they are continuing to install embankment material into the levee section. They have installed the bridge which was part of an old right of way agreement when the levee was originally built by the NLCLDD. Crosby has also installed the trash screen across the canal and demolished the old Edna pump station. NLLD expects them to complete the levee work in the next month and then they will be waiting for the pumps to be delivered for installation. C. Kief abstained from possible discussion. A motion was made by E. Pitre, seconded by K. Matherne to approve payment of a pay request in the amount of $150,993.66 from Crosby Dredging, LLC as recommended by the project engineer. No discussion or public comment. On call for the vote, Board President Kief abstained from the vote and the motion carried with no opposition. Lockport to Larose Reach B Levee Project: Director Dwayne Bourgeois reported Picciola & Associates continues to develop alternatives to the preliminary design and budgets for the proposed three phases of this levee reach. The Director feels confident NLLD is going to be able to return with some projects that can be pushed forward likely in a future budget. NLLD is continuing to work with Picciola and their Environmental consultant through some permitting issues with the quantifying of wetland impacts. Moving forward NLLD\ufffds plan is to continue to work on attaining the right of ways for the levee and for project access. NLLD has a meeting with Picciola & Associates (P&A) planned in the beginning of January to discuss the needed right of ways for the project. (P&A) was able to identify a couple of landowners willing to work with NLLD for access so NLLD will try and work through the details for the right of ways. Comeaux Drive Drainage Project: Director Dwayne Bourgeois reported the Town of Lockport had the drainage corridor right of ways cleared and the system was inspected from the inside. A site visit and consideration of the inspection revealed the system to be near the end of its practical life and in need of replacement. But, the sub-surface drainage system was still functioning to the extent that it didn\ufffdt seem to be the culprit of the flooding incidents observed north of LA1. To determine the actual problem, NLLD expanded the area for Leonard Chauvin P.E., Inc. to evaluate and develop recommendations for improvements. So, NLLD still has a bit more to consider before NLLD asks the board to consider the request for funding assistance made by the Town of Lockport for that purpose. D. Bourgeois said he has a meeting planned on January 10, 2020 with the Town of Lockport. Suring the call for any additional discussion in this project area discussion, D. Kiffe asked what is the percentage of completion for the Valentine Return Levee. Neil Angelette with Angelette-Picciola, LLC explained that Low Land is complete with the original scope of work from Hwy 1 to the drainage canal, they are now on the additional work added to their original contract and they are 75% complete and should be substantially complete in the next month. D. Kiffe asked when the 30- inch pump will be arriving for the Parr/Larose Pump Station. Neil Angelette with Angelette-Picciola, LLC said it should be arriving next month and the work should be wrapped up in the next three months. D. Kiffe also asked if Neil Angelette is working on the designs of the pipeline crossing, pumps and powerlines on the C4, C5, D1 project. Neil Angelette explained that the design for the pipeline area is complete and they are letting the material settle from the emergency repair for Onshore to build the final levee section while passing there. He added that there are a few concepts to consider around the Entergy powerline, but the design should be ready when Onshore gets there. Mr. Angelette explained that the work around the pump station will include some preliminary work, but a separate project might evolve for the pump station. Director Bourgeois agreed that it will be looked into further. D. Choupic Project Area There was nothing to report for this Project Area at this time. E. St. James Project Area Director Bourgeois reported NLLD is developing items in the Project Area via this drainage study by Duplantis Design Group (DDG). To remind everyone, the overall plan here is to allow Thibodaux to develop this area in a proactive, forward looking way; to avoid trying to correct for unplanned difficult drainage issues in the future. As reported last month DDG is creating a hydraulic model for this area. It will take several months to gather the input information. F. Lake Bouef Watershed Project Area Zeller/Larousse Forced Drainage Area Systems Improvements: Director Bourgeois reported Sealevel Construction completed the work in 2018 on Phase 1A of this project which included clearing encroachments and dredging the reservoir. NLLD is working on the development of Phase 2 of this project with the intent to make further improvements in elevation and stability of this levee. Leonard Chauvin P.E., Inc. (LCI) received the geotechnical information and it was favorable. LCI will be meeting with the geotechnical consultant to discuss the report in full but it appears NLLD will be able to reach the elevation within the existing footprint. NLLD\ufffds plan is to continue to work on the design of the project while working on finding the funding for this phase of the project. 40 and 80 Arpent and Halpins Canal Maintenance Dredging Project, East Theriot Canal Maintenance Dredging Project, and Sam Foret and adjacent Canals Maintenance Dredging: Director Bourgeois reported Sealevel Construction is the contractor for the hydraulic spray dredging of these canals and adjacent canals combined. They are currently dredging the 80 Arpent Canal towards Raceland Sugars. They are about 63% complete with the overall maintenance dredging of the project. A motion was made by P. Gasery, seconded by L. Andolsek to approve payment of a pay request in the amount of $138,442.12 from Sealevel Construction, Inc. as recommended by the project engineer. Commissioner Elmo Pitre was dismissed from the meeting at 6:02 pm. S. Testroet-Bergeron asked if NLLD was getting matched from the USACE for this project and D. Bourgeois said no. No further discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. G. Gheens Project Area Mathews Canal/Clotilda Levee Improvements Project: Director Bourgeois reported Low Land Construction Company is the contractor for this project. The certificate of substantial completion was accepted in August and the Clear Lien Certificate was issued. John Plaisance with GIS Engineering reported that the project is complete and the area of excessive settlement on the berm is being monitored for stabilization to be repaired. D. Kiffe asked if there will be a change order for the repair work in the future and John Plaisance with GIS said it will probably be a separate contract. A motion was made by R. Pitre, seconded by L. Andolsek to approve payment of the retainage pay request in the amount of $52,257.87 from Low Land Construction Co., Inc. as recommended by the project engineer. No further discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. Des Allemands Bulkhead Project: Director Bourgeois reported All South Consulting Engineers is monitoring the small sloughing area. Outer Limits installed additional material onto the levee and it is almost to the final section. NLLD will need to go and install some topsoil and seed the levee when getting closer to spring but the levee still appears to be stable after a couple of months of observation. Des Allemands FDA Pump Improvement Project: Director Bourgeois reported as awarded last month, Sealevel Construction Inc. is the contractor on this project that has GOMESA funds committed and includes the construction of a new pump station in Des Allemands and the removal of the existing pump station. The preconstruction meeting was held at the NLLD office on December 11, 2019. The Notice to Proceed will be issued for January 6, 2020. Jesse Dufrene FDA Levee Improvements: Director Bourgeois reported Onshore Materials, LLC is the contractor for this project which has GOMESA funding committed through CPRA and designed to raise four miles of levee height from +4\ufffd to +7\ufffd. Onshore is steadily moving material and installing onto the levee. They have started to backfill the canal which is part of the design to gain stability of the levee. A motion was made by D. Kiffe, seconded by L. Andolsek to approve payment of a pay request in the amount of $57,770.69 from Onshore Materials, LLC as recommended by the project engineer. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. Natural Gas FDA Levee Improvements: Director Bourgeois reported the other half of the protection for the Gheens Community is the Natural Gas FDA. NLLD wants to have this project framed up because, like Jessie Dufrene, it is a prime candidate for GOMESA funds, should they become available. NLLD has executed the Engineering contract with All South Consulting Engineers (ASCE) for this project. The NLCLDD has directed ASCE to prepare a final design for this project with a plan of bidding the project out next year (2020). Upper Barataria Risk Reduction (UBRRP) Project: Director Bourgeois reported this project is included in the State\ufffds Master Plan for 2017 and the project team has spent some time working with the CPRA on project details to help shape the action for the Corps\ufffd new start design funding. NLLD wants to be able to be sure that the Corps\ufffd efforts blend in well with the design team and the efforts of CPRA. The Corps has just released its draft report on their study of the project. The good news is that the alignment is in agreement with NLLD\ufffds alignment. But, NLLD has some work to do to confirm the cost and their BC ratio conclusions. The NLLD and the Lafourche Basin Levee District (LBLD) have been working cooperatively to get this design further down the road. Both levee districts have a Cooperative Endeavor Agreement with the LBLD in place for the project design team to advance the project through permitting and preliminary design. NLLD would like to continue this design effort into next year in a similar way for the Morganza project. More on that when NLLD gets it scoped out. President C. Kief asked how NLLD could qualify for LA Watershed Initiative Grant money on this. D. Bourgeois said there are serious restrictions for the use of the funding and Reggie Dupre with Terrebonne Levee District will take charge on this effort and try to qualify the money towards a certain section of the Morganza to the Gulf Project. But, the Flood Control Structure in Des Allemands might be a candidate and is being submitted. H. Valentine - East Project Area New Valentine/Ludevine FDA: Director Bourgeois reported this levee running from Hamilton St. in Larose about 5,500 feet towards the Ludevine Pump Station along the Blackwater Canal needs to be stabilized. Picciola & Associates is working on the final design and the bid package. This project was previously approved for advancement through the bid process and authorization of expropriation on the one remaining tract, if necessary. NLLD is still working on the final right of way. Although the Board authorized expropriation last month, NLLD has been trying to make a good faith effort to acquire the right of way. NLLD reached out to the landowner a few times and have not been able to make contact. NLLD is going to continue to try and obtain the right of way voluntarily but will get the review appraisal started so as not to hold up the project any longer. The bidding documents are ready so this right of way is the last thing needed to move this towards construction. Discussion ensued regarding the process involved in preparing for the expropriation documents and filing. I. Regional/Other Capital Projects Pump Station Study: Director Bourgeois reported this project is extending NLLD\ufffds influence into the proper operation of the pumps in Lafourche Parish to prevent possible damage from over pumping and the educational step is complete. C. Kief and P. Gasery attended the Award Ceremony. T. Baker Smith, LLC is finalizing the last set of reports and working to install the equipment in the last set of pump stations. NLLD expects by January to have all the pieces in place for NLLD\ufffds pump station monitoring project. P. Gasery said the award ceremony was very interesting and it shows that South Louisiana is creating very innovative technologies and making a national impact across the United States in water management. C. Kief publicly thanked T. Baker Smith, LLC for their work on this. Morganza to the Gulf: Director Bourgeois reported NLLD is working on a sustained new push in an attempt to find funding for the federally authorized Morganza to the Gulf Project which now comes well into the jurisdiction of the NLLD. This push includes a re-evaluation of their estimated cost of the project. NLLD has been working at all levels of the Corps, Louisiana Delegation in DC, State legislators and others in this effort. The report generated from the Study was very favorable in that it demonstrated that the Corps could build out this system to a 1% AEP LORR to the year 2035 at a cost of $3.2B as compared to the prior PACR estimate of > $10.6B (>$15B today). The report has moved from the District, through Division and is now at through HQ and on to the ASA-CW and it was highly featured as a new innovative, never been done before process by MG Toy at the MVFCA. So, lots of positive movement there. Things are progressing, but NLLD needs to keep pressure on this issue to get the goal of federal funding. NLLD arranged a flyover of the Morganza Project with Mr. RD James and his assistant Darren Lingle, USACE Mississippi Valley Division commander MG Toy along with Jim Bodron, Rich Feilbelman and Renee Turner from his office. From the District in New Orleans we had Col Murphy, Mark Wingate and Carol Burdine. This flyover took place on December 5th and in addition to all of those Corps folks the flight included D. Bourgeois and Chip Kline with CPRA. This flyover demonstrated both the need for Federal construction funds and the great work that the State and Locals have been making on this project. It was an opportunity to show the importance of this region to the nation. D. Bourgeois thinks this flight opened the eyes to a bunch of folks who had only seen this project on paper. As before, the three levee Districts are sharing the cost of this flyover. At this point, D. Bourgeois said he feels the three local levee districts (NLLD, SLLD, and TLCD) has buy-in from the Corps on the revised project cost and implementation as it was framed up at all levels of the Corps. They are working to express capability to start the project with funding for the project from Congress. Morganza to the Gulf (MTG), Larose to Lockport Feasibility Report: Director Bourgeois reported that Mitch Marmande with Delta Coast Consultants (DCC) is working on the design of the actual alignment of the levee within NLLD\ufffds District and to file the permit application. DCC has submitted the permit application for Reach 4. NLLD is currently working on an alignment shift for Reach 1 with the pipeline company prior to submitting that permit. NLLD has identified a project within Reach 2 that will not require a permit. The NLLD is working with GIS on this project and will have more once GIS gathers some of the initial survey information. Morganza to the Gulf (MTG), Reaches K & L and Structures: The CPRA will be providing $18.2M in funding for the Grand Bayou Flood gate between Reaches K & L in Lafourche Parish. This gate, along with the levees being constructed along Reaches K & L will have a very positive impact on the levees and gravity drainage on the west side of Bayou Lafourche as Grand Bayou is a big source of storm water for those areas. The funding was a joint ask of the state from all three local Levee Districts and a CEA for designated pre and post construction obligations was recently approved and executed by the Districts in August. So, more on that as NLLD moves forward. C. Kief asked when will the bidding start for the Grand Bayou Floodgate. D. Bourgeois said sometime early next year (2020). J. Equipment: Field Coordinator Glenn Bourgeois gave an update on equipment issues during the last month. MBI/CAT Buggy is still having issues as last month. They changed another pump and filters and it is running well now. The problem seems to be rust in the fuel tank. There was also a broken shaft on the buggy unit that a repair did not last on, and NLLD will get a new shaft made for it. Surplus CAT Hydraulic Excavator Upper Unit from Wilco pontoons: Director Bourgeois reported as discussed in the Finance & Priority Committee and the Regular Board meetings last month, November 19, 2019, the Wilco pontoons are being refurbished for the placement of a new upper unit to replace the old CAT Upper Unit. The advertisement for the replacement will be published for the bid opening to be conducted on Tuesday, January 14, 2020. With the refurbishment of the pontoons in the works, the CAT upper unit was removed and it needs to be declared surplus in order to advertise and receive bids for the sale of surplus equipment. Director Bourgeois added that Wilco put the upper unit onto a set of tracks for the purpose of mobility, and that might make it easier to sell since Wilco would be willing to sell the tracks with the upper unit if desired by the purchaser. D. Kiffe asked if Wilco is charging a storage fee. D. Bourgeois said Wilco will not charge a storage fee since they put the machine on a set of tracks and they can move it out of their way and possibly sell the tracks with it. Attorney Pat Amedee read the following resolution aloud: WHEREAS, the North Lafourche Conservation, Levee and Drainage District, is a duly authorized political subdivision of the State of Louisiana, Parish of Lafourche, a levee district created by Louisiana Revised Statute 38:291(T); and WHEREAS, the North Lafourche Conservation, Levee and Drainage District, was organized for the purpose and charged with the duty of constructing and maintaining levees, drainage, and all other things incidental thereto within its territorial limits, as defined by Louisiana Revised Statute 38:281(7); and WHEREAS, the North Lafourche Conservation, Levee and Drainage District in 2008 purchased a unit consisting of Wilco pontoons and a CAT Hydraulic Excavator upper unit that has worked over 11,000 hours for the charge of the District; and WHEREAS, the Finance & Priority Committee of the North Lafourche Conservation, Levee and Drainage District met on November 19, 2019 to review and consider the 2020 Proposed Budget including the replacement of the upper unit excavator onto the Wilco pontoons after refurbishment; and WHEREAS, the Regular Board met on November 19, 2019 and authorized the refurbishment of the Wilco pontoons and the advertisement of the invitation to bidders for the purchase of a new upper unit to be installed onto the refurbished Wilco pontoons; THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the North Lafourche Conservation, Levee and Drainage District Board of Commissioners, in regular session held on December 17, 2019 , by a vote of 8 for, 0 against, 0 abstained & 3 absent, the upper unit CAT Hydraulic Excavator 330 (Serial Number MWP02473) is no longer needed for public use and is declared surplus moveable property and the Executive Director of the North Lafourche Conservation, Levee and Drainage District is hereby instructed to dispose of the surplus unit post haste, in accordance with the applicable Laws of the State of Louisiana. A motion was made by S. Testroet-Bergeron, seconded by P. Gasery, to adopt the resolution as read. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. The Resolution declared adopted on the 17th day of December, 2019. Award of new Marsh Buggy Excavator: D. Bourgeois reported, as advertised, bids were received and publicly opened on Thursday, December 12, 2019. Three bids were received as listed in the bid tabulation in tonight\ufffds meeting packets and the lowest responsible bidder was Marsh Buggies Inc. with a bid amount of $427,624.00. The 2020 Budget as reviewed by the F&P Committee last month and adopted earlier in this board meeting, includes $500K for the new \ufffdTaz\ufffd multi-use marsh buggy. A motion was made by R. Pitre, seconded by R. Foret to authorize the Executive Director to issue a Notice of Award to Marsh Buggies Inc. to furnish and deliver a new marsh buggy excavator as detailed in the bid documents, allowing the Executive Director to sign all necessary documents for the purchase. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. K. General Items \ufffd Items for discussion or information as follows: In place of Project Manager Arthur Ostheimer, Field Coordinator Glenn Bourgeois presented photos and gave explanations on the following projects: LtoL C4, C5, D1; TLBB Element 2 Coastal to Twin Oaks Phase 1 and Phase 2; Gheens-Jesse Dufrene FDA Improvements; Edna/Barrios Pump Station NLLD Insurance Renewal: Director Bourgeois said he is pleased to report that NLLD received the Insurance Proposal from AJG for the 2020 renewal and the total premium is in line with the total premium for this expiring year. A copy of the proposal summary is in the board\ufffds meeting packets and D. Bourgeois\ufffd recommendation is for the board to authorize the renewal of the policies as listed in Program # 2 which adds Cyber & Privacy Liability coverage. A motion was made by S. Testroet-Bergeron, seconded by D. Kiffe to renew the insurance the same as the expiring coverage, plus Cyber & Privacy Liability coverage, at a total cost of $97,486.00 and to authorize the Executive Director to sign any and all documents and to pay the invoices as presented for payment. No discussion or public comment. Motion passed unanimously. NFIP Reform & Reauthorization Effort with CPRA via the LFRC: Director Bourgeois reported he and Executive Assistant K. DeRoche, along with CPRA made a trip last week to continue the efforts of pushing for an NFIP reauthorization/changes to the program before the end of this year. As of yesterday, the entire NFIP is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2019, along with the rest of the Federal Government. But, possibly earlier today, there will be a Continuing Resolution voted on that extends the operation of the Government (along with the NFIP) until September 30, 2020. Provided for the board is a meeting summary for each of these trips. This process is working out very well and is most helpful in these NFIP efforts. If the NFIP gets continued again, it will likely, as it did last year, give NLLD the opportunity to further influence the legislation written that would again hopefully be advanced. In short, D. Bourgeois said he took a look at how the House Bill was scored and believes to have an opportunity to dramatically reduce the score (cost) by removing some things and changing some things that should allow NLLD and CPRA to get some more of the things wanted. It\ufffds complicated for sure, too much to go into at this meeting and the entire thing will likely go dormant for a several months once they kick the can down the road again. But, it can confidently be said that a difference was made in the narrative going forward and the bills being proposed. The CPRA stood up an NFIP subcommittee to address these issues when no other State Agency would take the lead as they should have. Further, The CPRA has agreed to provide matching funds to the LFRC for continued advocacy. The CPRA has long recognized that the ALBL and the NLLD have been the leaders in this reform fight within the State. It is NLLD\ufffds goal to have the CPRA along with the entire State lead this fight going into next year. The rest of the State Agencies cannot and should not remain dormant. The parties/agencies involved will have to see what congress does to figure out what the joint effort looks like next year. There is a CPRA NFIP Sub-Committee meeting tomorrow. So, NLLD will see where this all goes at the beginning of next year. C. Kief said D. Bourgeois has done a tremendous amount of work necessary on this issue, but now the state of LA needs to have more of a leading role in this effort, working with ALBL and CPRA. Commissioner Rodney Foret left the meeting at 6:43 PM. Morganza Action Coalition (MAC): Director Bourgeois reported in 2016, the NLLD Board voted to join TLCD and SLLD in re-tasking the already established MAC to represent the three districts and aggressively promote the Morganza system as critical protection for the regional coastal communities and to push for authorization and funding on federal and state levels. The MAC Board of Directors is made up of members of the three levee districts and SCIA, along with residents of both Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes. C. Kief has been a member of the MAC board since 2016 and has been very active in shaping the direction of the MAC activities to date; but the time has come that he would like to step down and ask another one of the NLLD commissioners to volunteer as a member of the MAC Board of Directors. MAC meets typically on the third Tuesday of the month after the SCIA meeting in Houma and just before the NLLD regular meetings. Cory Kief explained that several nominees can be presented to MAC from NLLD, and the MAC Board would vote one to the board. Kief added that Tim Allen had previously expressed an interest in representing the NLCLDD on the MAC Board of Directors, and NLLD needs to offer a nominee in January. Other Meetings this Month: Director Bourgeois stated in addition to the regular monthly meeting circuit and those previously discussed, he participated in the following meetings: DC- NFIP: 11/20/19-11/22/19 HTV Going Public: 11/26/19 Discussion ensued regarding the next taping of NLLD on the show and consideration to invite the USACE Colonel or General, and CPRA representatives. C. Kief stated that D. Bourgeois, along with the other coastal regional levee districts has gotten more federal attention on the Morganza to the Gulf project than ever before and would like more educational/public outreach on it. He added that a future segment should spotlight NFIP. ALBL Annual Meeting: 12/3/19-12/5/19 USACE Morganza Flyover: 12/5/19 MVFCA Annual Meeting: 12/5/19-12/7/19 BIG Luncheon: 12/9/19 DC- NFIP: 12/10/19-12/12/19 Levee Consortium Meeting: 12/16/19 Finance & Priority Committee: Commissioner K. Matherne reported that the Finance and Priority Committee met on November 19, 2019. The NLLD Board has a copy of those minutes in tonight\ufffds meeting packet. During that meeting, the committee reviewed and approved the Payables report that was recommended and accepted for approval by the full board during the Regular Board meeting that followed. At that same meeting, the F&P committee reviewed the Proposed 2020 Budget prior to recommendation of adoption to the full board. Accounts Payable: In the meeting packets, the commissioners were provided with a financial report detailing year-to-date figures, as well as the current month\ufffds Accounts Payable listing. The chairman of the Finance & Priority was asked for the committee\ufffds recommendation. A motion was made by K. Matherne, seconded by L. Andolsek to accept the Payables Report as given.

DRAINAGE GENERAL POLICY\nRainfall runoff from storms of all return frequencies should enter and depart from property following development in substantially the same manner as under pre-development conditions. Any proposals to modify drainage characteristics must be fully justified by engineering data that shall demonstrate to the Public Works Director that hazards to life and property will not be increased by the proposed modifications.\n\nNo individual, partnership, or corporation shall deepen, widen, fill, reroute, or change the location of any existing ditch, stream, drain or drainage canal without first obtaining written permission from the Public Works Director.\n\nSEC. 28.1-193. DRAINAGE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS\n\n(a) Drainage Reports. A drainage report, prepared and certified by a civil engineer registered as a Professional Engineer in Louisiana, shall be submitted to and approved by the Public Works Director prior to construction of certain projects. The purpose of the report is to analyze the effect that a proposed development would have upon the rainfall runoff in the vicinity of the development, to provide data to insure that the development is designed to be protected from flooding, to provide data to insure that the development is designed to minimize flooding and to provide data supporting the design facilities to be constructed for the management of rainfall runoff. Each drainage report must consider rainfall runoff from storms with a return frequency up to and including a one hundred (100) year storm. The complexity of the report depends upon the nature of the development and the site on which the development will occur. A drainage report shall be submitted by an applicant requesting any of the following:\n\n(1)Approval of subdivision plat. Proposed subdivisions must develop a comprehensive drainage plan that addresses the drainage for the entire project site. Individual lot grading plans shall not alter the approved comprehensive drainage plan.;\n(2)A permit for grading;\n(3)A permit to construct right-of-way improvements;\n(4)A permit to construct any structure, with the exception of a single-family residential structure; and\n(5)Construction of any drainage structure or channel.\n\n(b) Storm Water Storage Facilities. Except as noted below, development of all land within the city must include provisions for the management of storm water runoff from the property that is to be developed. This management may consist of constructing storm water storage facilities, such as detention basins. The basins and drainage system shall be designed such that the peak post-development storm water flow does not exceed the peak pre-development storm water flow. As a minimum, this flow shall be based on a one hundred (100) year storm. The developer and/or commercial business shall provide for maintenance of the storm water storage facilities such that they continue to operate as designed.\n\nThe requirement for construction of a storm water storage facility may be waived in the following cases:\n\n(1)The runoff has been included in a storage facility at another location;\n(2)Construction of only a single-family residential structure;\n(3)Development adjacent to a flood way or a drainage channel which has been determined by the Public Works Director, using engineering analyses provided by the developer, to have been designed and constructed to handle the additional runoff flow without increasing the potential for flood damage on any other downstream property; and\n(4)Development of a parcel under one-half acre in an area where it can be demonstrated by engineering analyses that no significant increase in the potential for flood damage will be created by the development.\n\n(c) Easements. Adequate easements must be dedicated for the construction and maintenance of any new or relocated drainage channels. All drainage easements to the City of Natchitoches shall be identified and dedicated as early as possible in the development process, but in no case shall a building permit be issued until the city has received and accepted the easement. The dedication instrument shall consist of a survey plat by a licensed professional Land Surveyor, with an accompanying legal description. The survey plat shall show the proposed easement, any existing drainage easements, any flood plain areas within the tract, and any existing drainage easements intersecting the proposed easement.\n\n(d) Flood run-off. Provisions shall be made for the best available routing of run-off water to assure that buildings or other important facilities will not be endangered by the path of major emergency flood run-off which would become active if the capacity of site?s storm drainage system is exceeded.\n\nSEC. 28.1-194. DRAINAGE SPECIFICATIONS\nWhere deemed necessary by the Public Works Director, subsurface drainage pipes, concrete curbs and gutters, catch basins, and culverts or bridges will be required.\n\n(a)The design and construction of all drainage facilities shall be made under the supervision and approval of a Civil Engineer currently licensed in the State of Louisiana. Such design shall be based upon Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development rainfall recommendations.\n\n(b)A Civil Engineer, currently licensed in the State of Louisiana shall certify the type of culvert material and culvert size, and that the structural requirements for a HS-20-44 vehicular loading has been provided. All bridges shall be designed for a HS-20-44 vehicular loading.\n\n(c)All bridge and drainage construction shall be in accordance with the latest edition of Louisiana Standard Specifications for Roads and Bridges, as published by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, Office of Highways, Baton Rouge.

APPEAL: RHODES PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT, LLC\n\nPurpose: The City Council to review a decision of the Natchitoches Planning and Zoning Commission at the December 3, 2019 meeting that denied the application regarding the St. Maurice Subdivision.\n\nMayor Posey opened the floor for public comments in reference to the appeal.\n\nMr. Jared Dunahoe approached the podium on behalf of Rhodes Properties and Development. He stated they are here in reference to the appeal as it relates to the December 3rd decision of Planning and Zoning to deny the application for the Saint Maurice Place subdivision project. This is the second time we have been before the council for an appeal. In the first application the Planning and Zoning Commission and City denied the application for what he believes to be two specific reasons: each of the lots did not front a City street and the right of way was only 50 feet wide as opposed to the 60 feet requirement. Our clients respectfully disagreed with that decision and filed a new application to address those two concerns. This is the application that is before you tonight in which every lot faces a city street and the right of way is 60 feet wide. Under this application, the Rhodes are 100% in compliance with the Planning and Zoning requirements and laws set forth by the City which surprises us that the commission denied the application. There was discussion at the hearing as to whether or not the subdivision street should connect to Oma Street because right now it is a cul-de-sac and there is a provision that addresses connecting streets. This only arises if the commission makes the decision that the public needs those streets to connect. He believes the commission?s decision to deny the application was brought on by opposition within the existing neighborhood. One concern raised was drainage and that would primarily be addressed during another stage and shouldn?t be the premise for denying this project. The other concern was the size of the lots. Each lot meets the 7200 foot requirement that the City has enacted. He then stated, the neighborhood thinks the lots should be bigger, but that is not how the system works. The City has decided this is the minimum requirement for lot size and the commission cannot come in knowing what the law state and decide for this subdivision we are going to require larger lots. He also pointed out the 7200 foot lot size is not inconsistent with the existing neighborhood. He stated it is frustrating to his clients that this almost identical subdivision was approved when Eddie Ahrens presented it to the commission other than one lot difference. Tonight?s decision is about whether or not Natchitoches is going to be a city that follows rules or make up the rules as we go along to achieve a desired result. Mr. Dunahoe ended by stating, tonight we ask the City Council to reverse the commission decision and approve the application.\n\nMayor Posey asked a question to Mrs. Fowler. How many houses did the original Eddie Ehrens application have and was it in fact approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission?\n\nMrs. Fowler stated the application of Mr. Ahrens was done many years ago. There were more differences in his application than just one lot. Mr. Ahrens did not pursue the project once it was approved by the commission. At one point it was denied and he was asked to come back with changes which he did and then the commission approved his application. However there was an appeal of the application to the City Council and that is where things changed for his project. This project included 27 lots with a dedicated right of way which the commission acknowledged. The commission did not have any major objections as it related to the cul de sac, but the main concern was the density of the lot in the subdivision. Each commissioner weighed in on their thoughts about character and location capability of 27 lots. This is how their decision was decided.\n\nMr. Dunahoe added the material differences of the Rhodes application and Mr. Ahrens application are things that make the Rhodes application more in compliant with the regulations. He stated that is why they think the preliminary plat should be approved at this stage.\n\nMs. Morrow questioned is 27 lots correct?\n\nMrs. Fowler stated yes, 27 lots. The other changes that were applicable involved where there would or would not have been a retention pond. There are two lots, one of them dedicated as a green space and the other lot there was no indication of what would be there. The other topic of discussion was whether the subdivision would be gated or not and the developer indicated there was no intent to request a gate. If the street is a dedicated street it should remain open for public use.\n\nMs. Morrow asked so the retention pond has been removed and the street is now a public street?\n\nMr. Ralph Ingram approached the podium stating he has given a list of the reasons he is opposed to the Saint Maurice Place subdivision and is asking the council to vote against this proposed subdivision. This is not in keeping with the neighborhood and will decrease the value of the surrounding property.\n\nMr. Thomas Reynolds stated the issue today is about the plat and one thing Mr. Dunahoe did not clarify enough in his remarks is that the Planning and Zoning Commission clearly had concerns about the character of the neighborhood and the project may not fit that. They would have you believe the size of the lot is not an indicator of the character of the neighborhood. The size of the lots determine home size, space between homes and the landscaping surrounding those homes all of which are the curb appeal and the value of the homes in that area. The home lots in Rose Lawn are much larger than the proposed lot size for this project. Mr. Reynolds asked the council to consider the size of the lots that matter a great deal on the kind of construction that will happen and clearly not be in character with the neighborhood.\n\nMs. Carolyn Breedlove stated it takes a fair amount of audacity to file a new application while you have a lawsuit pending against the city. It takes a fair amount of arrogance to pretend that the City Council did not specifically uphold Planning and Zoning?s decision the last time this application was followed in September. Mr. Harrington specifically read from the ordinance that new development has to be in keeping the character of the existing neighborhood. This incredibly high density development is in no way of keeping with the character. The Council specifically declined to overturn the last Planning and Zoning decision because it was considered necessary to make it a thru street to connect to Oma and existing street. Mr. Dunhoe did not say it here, but he did at the Planning and Zoning meeting that due to the condition of Oma Street they refuse to do that. She stated she thinks this whole attitude is when people show you who they are, believe them the first time. The kind of contempt and disregard being shown to the residents in this neighborhood I think will be a pretty good predictor of how this project will play out forever.\n\nMr. Rodney Allen stated the long term residents of this area have contributed to the value of this area and do not think the value will hold up if this plan is allowed to move forward.\n\nMr. Richard Jensen then stated he agrees with the previous speakers and is very concerned with this overdevelopment. He stated he is really moved the Planning and Zoning Commission along with the City Council have stood up for the people of Natchitoches. He does have a concern along with several neighbors of flooding in this area as it is and an extensive development will cause this to worsen. This development company doesn?t have a very good reputation and he doesn?t trust them.\n\nMrs. Billy Sepulvado stated yes the Rose Lawn subdivision lots were the same size as the proposed lot, but most of those houses are on two or more lots combined so it is nowhere close to being the same. It was said this is just the preliminary stage and my experience has been it doesn?t get better as we go on and she doesn?t have much confidence in this.\n\nCouncilman Batiste stated his interest at this point was reviewing the home rule charter and code of ordinances as it related to this project. He discussed potential flooding, sharing of back yards, and retention pond that raise issues for him as well as the flow of traffic. These residents are entitled by legislation and acts of God as it relates to this subdivision.\n\nCouncilman Harrington stated previously we denied the application for lack of a public road and the right of way not being in compliance, but it has been stated we denied based on Section 5 of our ordinances which is the character of the development which has once again not been addressed. He stated it is my opinion it does not meet the character of the adjoining property as the ordinance states. It was brought up that some adjoining properties are the same size, but we?ve beat the Nazi?s since then. The average lot size of adjoining properties surrounding this is 20,000 to 21,000 square feet. He stated he cannot speak for the Ahrens application before, but every application stands on its own. How we interpret the rules in the Code of Ordinances is ever changing and this is how he interprets it. In reference to the cul de sac it was stated the commissioners didn?t have a problem with there being one, but each commissioner was asked what their issues were and Mr. Whitehead asked would a breakthrough to Oma Street change the decision and the decision was a unanimous no. The main issue was the character of the development. He then stated he has no reason to believe Rhodes does substandard work and they are a very reputable company that is based here in Natchitoches. This is nothing against Rhodes, but about the location of where it is.\n\nCouncilman Mims stated there is a development in Shreveport called Provenance right off the Southern Loop and he thinks this is the style of property he thinks the Rhodes are trying to establish and it?s an absolutely gorgeous place. Matter of fact, we when decided to downsize, we looked at this area. The lots are fairly close together, but they have large parks, ponds, recreation opportunities set up for this. It is set up to handle the volume of people, volume of traffic, etc. He thinks there is a place in Natchitoches for a project like this, but this location and lot size can?t handle what he is talking about.\n\nMs. Morrow then stated according to Mr. Dunahoe every lot meets the requirements and the application is in compliance with the City?s rules. It is her understanding there will be 27 houses which she had hoped it would be less than that. There were no flooding issues or maps submitted to the Council or Planning and Zoning, but tonight we are hearing about flooding issues. She has no bad things to report about the Rhodes and doesn?t think those negative comments should be taken into consideration. She then stated the Council should vote according to the law versus personal opinion.\n\nCouncilman Nielsen stated they have tried to work with the Rhodes to bring it down and they did make several concessions however one key point was density and he doesn?t think that was a huge secret to anyone and to get it passed at Planning and Zoning that would have to be addressed. The application we got did not reflect much give on that besides one lot.\n\nCouncilman Nielsen then made a motion to uphold the decision of the Natchitoches Planning and Zoning Commission at the December 3, 2019 meeting that denied the application regarding the St. Maurice Subdivision. Mr. Harrington seconded the motion and a roll call vote was recorded as follows:\nAyes:Batiste, Nielsen, Mims, Harrington\nNays:Morrow\nAbsent:None\nAbstain:None\n\nThe following Ordinance was Introduced by Mr. Harrington and Seconded by Mr. Nielsen as follows, to-wit:\n\nORDINANCE NO. 005 OF 2020\n\nAN ORDINANCE AMENDING ORDINANCE NO. 64 OF 2001 BY CHANGING ZONING CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS:\n\nTO REZONE THE FOLLOWING: Lot Containing 1.132 Acres ?

President Justin Edwards, Board Member Pasty Carter, Board Member Andrew Tant, Board Member John Bruce, Board Member Rick Wilder, and Secretary Judy Hoffman. Engineer Glenn Turner and Kathryn McDuff with Meyer, Meyer, Lacroix, and Hixson. Louisiana Rural Water representatives were Mr. Clarence Beebe and Mr. Rusty Reeves.\nMayor Olden welcomed everyone and opened the floor for discussion.\nPresident Justin Edwards asked Glenn Turner, engineer for Red Hill Water if he could explain the common problem Red Hill Water System is having with non compliance with Louisiana Dept. of Health (LDH) regulations concerning disinfectant by products (DBPs) aka Trihalomethanes (TTHMs).\nGlenn Turner explained to the Mayor and Board of Aldermen what DBPs aka TTHMs are and what causes them to form in the water. The byproducts have always been in water that has to be treated with chlorine. LDH did not enforce the allowed levels until about 5 years ago when EPA put pressure on them to do so. The majority of water systems in the state are not in compliance and can?t get there without a filtering system or some means to control TTHMs. Red Hill Waterworks has been given the option to have an aeration equipment system installed to lower the levels to be able to meet compliance with LDH rules. The plans for this project are being reviewed by LDH engineers at this time. The estimated cost of the project is around $800,000-$850,000 which will be financed by a loan from Cobank. Red Hill Waterworks is operating under administrative order. Red Hill Waterworks has been forced by LDH to take action to comply with the administrative order to lower the levels of the byproducts and achieve compliance with LDH?s rules. With Red Hill Waterworks being out of compliance, it also puts Village of Georgetown out of compliance because of the water being purchased from Red Hill Waterworks. The overall goal is to get the aeration equipment system so both systems can be in compliance.\nMr. Clarence Beebe with L.R.W.A. spoke about the rate analysis process. He assisted Red Hill with the information that was submitted to the legislative auditor?s office in Baton Rouge. After reviewing the information, they approved a rate increase as requested. The rate increase is needed to help cover the loan expense for the aeration equipment system.\nMr. Rusty Reeves with L.W.R.A. then spoke about the merging of small water systems that are in non-compliant situations. LDH has created a public health water infrastructure consolidation initiative and they are offering incentives to encourage merging. Some of the incentives were discussed.\nMr. Reeves and Mr. Turner are going to try and get someone from LDH to come meet with Red Hill Waterworks and Village of Georgetown on the process, pro, and cons of merging the systems.\nAfter further discussion, Mayor Danny Olden asked Red Hill Waterworks and their representatives to come up with what they needed from the Village of Georgetown to help with this matter. At this time, there is just not enough information on the funding for this project and more information is needed. All agreed to look into the funding options and to meet again at a later time.\nMeeting adjourned.\nNext Regular town meeting will be held on Monday, February 10, 2020 @ 7:00 p.m.\nDanny Olden, Mayor\n60.20 2/27"}}, "Iberville": {"1": {"paper": "Plaquemine Post/South", "date": "20200127", "text": "ADVERTISEMENT FOR RE-BIDS\n\nSealed bids will be received by Town of White Castle, Louisiana at the town hall office, 32535 Bowie Street, White Castle, Louisiana 70788 until 11:00 O? clock A.M., Tuesday March 03, 2020 Local time and then at said office publicly opened and read aloud for the following project:\n\nWater Meter Replacement\n\nSTATEMENT OF WORK:\n\nPROJECT CONSISTS OF REPLACING ALL EXISTING WATER METERS AND RELATED IMPROVEMENTS\n\nCopies of Specifications, Bid Documents, Contract Documents and Construction Drawings for use in preparing Bids, on a Flash drive, free of cost, can be obtained from the Engineer?s office, MB Design Consultants, 8841 Bluebonnet Blvd., Suite A, Baton Rouge, LA 70810.

Michele Blanchard Thomas (T.J.) Smith, Jr. SPECIAL ITEMS Lorino - 1) Ord. Cal. No. 6241 - Ordinance to adopt the 2020 Operating Budget. Lorino/Brister) (Introduced 9/25/19 Special Council Meeting) (Postponed 1013119 & 11/7/19) Carlo - Hernandez - there are several outside agencies who are proposing salary increases. In the future, the funds that are now available will not be available in a few years. He thinks the Council needs to be sure to not waive zoning fees. This year the waived fees were only about $1000. He hopes, considering the critical funding situation, that no more fees will be waived. Canulette - moved to adopt, second by O\ufffdBrien. Unanimous with 2 absent (Tanner, Binder); becomes Ordinance C.S. No. 19-4178. Lorino -2) Ord. Cal. No. 6242- Ordinance to establish the 2020-2024 Capital Improvement Budget and Capital Assets.

Unanimous with 2 absent (Tanner, Binder); becomes Ordinance C.S. No. 19-4179. PRESENTATIONS Lorino - 1. Presentation of Proclamation to St. Tammany Parish Government Employee of the Month. (Brister) Brister - this is a very emotional night for her. She wants to all employees to continue to do their jobs professionally. She thanks all employees for everything they have done to make her and the Council look good, especially those who were always on call and left their families to protect the Parish. Lorino - 2. Presentation by Gail Core regarding Animal Protection. (Toledano) Toledano - need to postpone this to the January meeting. Presentations to Parish President Brister and outgoing Council Members - James \ufffdRed\ufffd Thompson, Jacob \ufffdJake\ufffd Groby, E.L. \ufffdGene\ufffd Bellisario, and S. Michele Blanchard by the remaining Parish Council Members. Lorino - we need to move up Ord. Cal. No. 6284 considering the number of people here to speak on it. Lorino -23. Ord. Cal. No. 6284 - Ordinance amending the official Parish Zoning Map to reclassify 69.46 acres located south and west of Ochsner, west of LA Highway 21, Covington from PBC-2 (Planned Business Center) to AML (Advanced Manufacturing and Logistics District). (Ward 1, District 1) (Dean) (2019-1530-ZC) (Introduced 11/7/19) Paul Mayronne - this is not an appeal, the merits of this request were heard and decided in November. The only item to decide is whether or not to adopt the ordinance. There is no reason to not adopt. This would be a down zoning, being less intense and creating less traffic. The closest residence is a quarter mile away, which is the farthest than any staff recommended for approval. Bonnie Eades - executive director of Northshore Business Council - they have 65 CEOs of businesses in St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Washington Parishes all promoting a better commercial environment. They think bringing this company will improve the Parish and provide substantial revenue to schools, libraries, parks, etc, They believe that this chosen location can and will support the Parish. The Medical field is the biggest in the Parish. This company will ensure that hospitals, clinics, dialysis clinics, etc. are always supplied. Please do not ask them to leave by denying this ordinance. Chris Masingill -CEO of St. Tammany Corp. - they respect that it is difficult to hear both sides and make a good decision, but they stand by their decision to recommend this Company. For every dollar that we spend our economy earns $5. Medline is known as an excellent employer, and the reality is that projects of this magnitude will help our children and grandchildren continue to live and work in this Parish. Gus Lehmann - thinks that common sense and safety should be considered over profits. His wife was killed in 2018 due to a dangerous highway condition in a regularly traveled area. There were 952 accidents between 2012 and 2016, and it is not going to get better until the highway gets better and the access roads are expanded. Medline will create more traffic. Randy Loewen - he is with the Milling Firm - Medline is a good business, but the wrong location. During Comprehensive Rezoning, Mr. Dean worked with Mr. Wainer to rezone this to PBC-I and now, again he wants AML. The purchase agreement states that if Medline does not buy the property, they will pay to rezone back to PBC-2. Spot zoning is highly suspect. They think it will be more like 1200 trucks, not only 170. This rezoning is contrary to the long term comprehensive plan. Ronnie Spencer - Normandy Oaks - Medline causes concerns about traffic nightmares and vehicular deaths involving 18 wheel trucks. He doesn\ufffdt think that Ochsner Blvd. is wide enough to allow trucks to turn. He is opposed to this rezoning. Nancy Wagner - she has a statement from Stone Creek Spa asking the Council to oppose this rezoning and especially not to allow deed restrictions which will not be enforced by the Parish. Don Alette - Coalition for responsible zoning - he is a professional engineer. Comprehensive rezoning helps people decide where to move. To rezone this property would erode trust. The uses allowed under AML are some of the most dangerous with the risks of accidents and chemical releases, spills, fires, explosions maybe requiring the evacuation of 1000s of residents and businesses. Tessera Crockett - Southeastern Louisiana University - rezoning will threaten local waters, drainage, and danger to local wetlands. This proposal is inconsistent with the hydrology of forest-covered wetlands. Medline has not applied for a scenic river permit. This rezoning must not move forward. Alvin Davis -former VP of Latter and Blum - he is a specialist in industrial real estate. This project is going to bring industrial property next to residential. In other areas such as Baton Rouge and Metairie, industrial areas are far away from residents. Matthew Allen - flood plain manager - there are flood issues with this project. When the river overflows it flows down to Flowers Bayou which is right across from this project. FEMA\ufffds latest study shows this area being inundated with another 100 year flood and several 10 year floods. Wetlands are invaluable for runoff and placing a monolithic structure to redirect flood waters onto the surrounding neighborhoods. Barbara Jackson - the community around 1-12 and Highway 21 is a vibrant and thriving area. Mr. Wainer and Mr. Dean rezoned this property in 2009 from residential to PBC-2 which would be developed slowly. The need for PBC is important, introduction of industrial businesses would be disruptive to the area. Elise Read - traffic is associated with the construction of this project which will cause vibrations, noise, heavy equipment, and the laying of concrete. There is the potential of 1.50 construction vehicles in 1 day with only 2 ways in and out. Michael Jackson - Flowers Estates is surrounded by Flowers Bayou. He wants to know what value and improvements bring to the local residents? Please listen to the constituents. This project is a bad idea. Debra Hebert - with the Coalition for Responsible Zoning, more than half of Medline\ufffds current employees live in Tangipahoa Parish. Dwight Doskey - Flowers Estates - his family has been here for 70 years, and he feels lucky to have grown up here. The 2025 plan was a promise of how the Parish would expand responsibly. Many residents are not strong enough or financially secure enough to pick up and move. He is asking the Council to vote against Medline for their constituents. Tim Hodgis - he has moved 11 times in 40 years and lived in many growth areas of the country. He selected to live in this Parish. He will probably will retire to Georgia in 40 years, but he is concerned about the resale value of his home. He also doesn\ufffdt think he would have moved his father-in-law into assisted living if he would have know what was going to happen in this area. Please listen to the people. Margie Vicknair-Pray - she is a resident of the Parish and with the Sierra Club. The amount of development going on is overwhelming and goes against 2025 and responsible, intelligent development. Please vote against it. Groby - his concerns are the same as last month. He is concerned about possible abatement of property taxes from the Parish. He already has problems with the distribution center in his District. Fire District 3 is rolling back its services because of limited income from publically owned companies. Dean - moved to adopt, second by Blanchard. Motion passed with 10 yeas, 2 nays (Groby, Smith) and 2 absent (Tanner, Binder); becomes Ordinance C.S. No. 19- 4202.

(Lorino) (Introduced 11/7/19) Kyle Cooper - he is with the Homebuilders Association and working with St. Tammany Corp. They believe that moratoriums are not good for residents or businesses and should only be used in emergency cases. He is asking that the moratoriums be tabled or reconsidered month to month. Lorino - on Highway 22 a traffic study showed that there was too much traffic and now the Regional Planning Commission is offering money to help build two roundabouts and turning lanes. He thinks only one month is too little time, because it took him months to get the information he needed to move forward and solve this problem. Blanchard - she has not placed a moratorium, but respects the reasons they have been put in place, but she is sure that council members would listen and respect any requests to be removed from the moratorium. Canulette - we do need to look at how moratoriums are handled. Smith - because of growth outpacing the infrastructure, moratoriums help with responsible growth.

Discussion: Mr. Mike Duffy with Enterprise Fleet Management addressed the council. Mr. Duffy stated he has been working with the city for the past few months on the analysis of the vehicles we use for operations. 40% of our fleet is light duty vehicles with over 10 years of age. With aged vehicles, we look at higher maintenance and higher fuel costs. We are looking at a fleet of 21 vehicles. In the first year we will replace 12 vehicles, the 2nd year 7 vehicles and the 3rd year 2 vehicles. This is how it will be every 3 years if we wish. Right now, we are paying over $40,000 a year on maintenance and $50,000 on fuel. This will definitely be a savings to us. Councilman Higginbotham questioned how do we decide which vehicles to trade in? Duffy explained it is based on the age of the vehicle and the mileage. Mayor Bourque stated the maintenance cost will become part of the lease and the maintenance will be done at local vendors. These vehicles are for public works. Mel stated this will be an advantage to us, because sometimes we have trucks in the shops for 2 and 3 days at a time, because of the age of the vehicles. Councilman Delahoussaye stated he did this with his business in the past and it does work, and you get more out of it. He feels moving forward this will benefit us. Question was raised, what if we want to get out of it early? Duffy stated in a 3-year term, we can get out early. Councilman Higginbotham questioned if we have a penalty for high mileage? Duffy stated no, because it is different from a dealership lease. Councilman Bonin questioned; Don is this is legal with the bid law? Don stated yes, it is, because we are strictly leasing the vehicles; therefore, the bid law does not apply.

Previously the Engineer of Record only was required to certify. d) Sidewalks are required in Residential Subdivisions e) On roads, requirement is a minimum 12\" thick base course rather than a 10\" base course f) Prohibits the construction of fences across public easements g) Allows the Commission to grant set back waivers at the time of Preliminary Plat approval. Councilman Bonin questioned what commission grants the waivers? Walter stated the Planning Commission, only on Preliminary Plats. The council is the ultimate authority. Chief Decou questioned if this addresses the placement of dumpsters. Walter state no. Mayor Bourque stated that Ben Theriot enforces these situations. Councilman Regan questioned on item #c, is this for additional recourse in the future? Walter stated he wants everyone to say that everything is correct as far as they know. Councilman Gary questioned regarding the fencing, if they set it correctly, is the city responsible for cleaning the ditches? Walter stated yes. We should be cleaning ditches every 2 years.

Final Resolution: Motion Approved YEAS: David Bonin Jesse Regan Michael Rabon Kenny Higginbotham Ray Gary Jeff Delahoussaye ABSENT: Angel Racca 6.2 Cliff Guidry/East Main Street Development Cliff addressed the council regarding his intentions for his property across the street from City Hall. His intention is to design something to beautify Broussard. Right now, he has a commitment from the following tenants, a State Farm Office, Hair Salon and Heritage Wealth Management managed by Jerry Lynn. His original design was to put parking in the front; but that would too dangerous with the roadway curving. He approached the adjacent property owner, but they are not willing to sell. He would like to present an option as where he would put parking in the rear and maybe join with the city to make their adjacent lot a parking lot. Mayor Bourque stated the final Charette Closing is March 2, 2020. After that time, the council will come together to see what is affordable. Mayor Bourque added that Cliff has really embraced the revitalization of the downtown. One thing they do know is that more parking is needed. The city does own the lot next to Mr. Guidry's property and the lot where the city dumpsters are. Walter added a successful downtown is a walkable downtown. Daniel Hutchinson came up with the potential cost of the pavements of the lots. The property where the dumpsters are would be $167,000; the property across the street from city hall would be $42,000 and the area Mr. Guidry donates would be $32,000. This is merely for discussion; no action is needed tonight. Jeremy Hidalgo added on a Financial and Business aspect the property is 11,600 square feet and is valued at $52,000 market value. This would be a win situation for everyone. If the city accepts the donation it would be a public parking lot. Councilman Bonin questioned, what if another administration has other ideas for this property in the future? Don stated we can write it into the donation agreement. The council all agreed with Mr. Guidry's proposal. Walter stated the city would have to allocate the funds for public bid, before anything can be done. If agreed upon we will do this at the end of Mr. Guidry's construction. Don stated the donation will come first. 6.3 Fire Department 2019 Annual Report Deputy Chief Justin Denais presented the 2019 Annual Report. Some of the major accomplishments of 2019 were: a) a facelift and an addition was done to Station 3, b) they implemented an electronic work chart and truck check system, c) completed the process of lowering our Fire Rating to a class 3, d) formed and trained our own Honor Guard and e) budgeted and appointed our First Prevention Officer.

The term \"professional services\" shall mean, in general, work rendered by a person or entity with a professed knowledge of some department of learning or science used by its practical application to the affairs of others or in the practice of an art founded on it. Professional services shall include, by way of illustration, but shall not be limited to, the services of a licensed and certified architect, engineer, and accountant as well as appraisal services, governmental relations, testing and inspection, and geotechnical services, including any related disciplines and incidental services that members of these professions and those in their employ may logically or justifiably perform. The term \"professional services\" shall not include legal services, such services being governed by Section 4-03 of the Lafayette City-Parish Consolidated Government Home Rule Charter. In addition to the foregoing, the committee may, in its discretion, designate additional services or disciplines as \"professional services\" after consideration and evaluation of the following illustrative, non-exhaustive criteria: 1.

With reference to architectural related projects, fees should be based on the latest revision of the Louisiana Capital Improvements Projects Procedure Manual for Design and Construction. Fees for engineering-related projects should be based on a Fixed Fee Compensation Chart and/or Hourly Rate Schedule to be developed by the Lafayette Mayor-President or his designee. A complexity factor may be used to modify the fixed fee if warranted.

Mayor Piazza asked Councilman Francis Touchet, Jr. to lead the assembly in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nMayor Piazza asked if there were any comments from the public on any agenda item. There were none.\n\nCouncilwoman Broussard stated Mr. Norman (Mayo) Levine is one of the greatest helpers in her district. He has some questions about LaFitte Park so she asked him to come to the meeting tonight to discuss his concerns. Mr. Levine stated when the park first started with Councilman Wayne Landry, he was told it would be a fishing pond, a civic center and a water park. It looks like we don?t even have a plan for the park. Councilman Plaisance stated there is a detailed plan for the park and he had it with him tonight for Mr. Levine to look over. There are no plans for a water park and we do not have plans for a civic center yet. A civic center could be a possibility but we do not have a plan for that. There is a 23-acre fishing pond and it is fully stocked. At some point in the future we hope to be able to allow fishing. We have applied for a $400,000 grant which would include a walking trail and a fishing pier. Last Thursday, he approached the Lieutenant Governor?s office about assistance in trying to secure the grant. Within 24 hours, he had a response from the Lieutenant Governor?s office and they are working on that right now. The dog park is open. PetSense donated $1,000 of items for the dog park today. They will be a sponsor for our park. They also asked us to apply for a grant with them for the dog park. We are not yet prepared to have the park open full-time yet. It is still in the developmental stages. A lot of things have been donated and we hope we will not have to approach the City for any funds for the park. We are setting up another organization to help with the park. It will be called the Friends of LaFitte Drive-In Park. That is all in the process right now. We need grant money to develop the fishing pier and the walking trail. The concrete tables were purchased and donated by several businesses. Raising Canes is interested in participating in the park. We will utilize the new fundraising organization to raise funds for the park. The pond is fully stocked. The Department of Wildlife and Fisheries have donated all the fish except for $600 of it. Councilwoman White stated the pond was built as a retention pond. We cannot allow fishing without a pier because it is not safe for our citizens. We have allocated $50,000 in our budget as the City?s share of the grant. The pier will cost $250,000. Mayor Piazza stated the additional property at the park was purchased because we sold property at the airport. A lot of things have been talked about and several ideas have been kicked around. All those things take a lot of money that we don?t have so we have to rely on grants. Some grants take a long time. Our sidewalk project took 9 years. Councilman Plaisance and Councilwoman Broussard went out and solicited donations for the benches and bar-b-que pits. The fence for the dog park was not a large project because most of the fence was already up. We want to utilize the park as best as we can with as little money as possible. There are a lot of questions that, at this time, we do not have the answers. But those answers will come up at our Parks and Recreation Board meetings. You can attend our Parks and Recreation Board meetings to address your concerns with this park or any other park or you can visit with Denise Mire, our Parks Director. We have to make sure the things we do there are cost effective and safe for the public. Money is raised for these parks by organizations like Friends of the Park. The government does not just dish out money to fund these parks. The group goes out and raises money for the park. If you are that concerned, Mr. Levine, then you and other people like you need to join the Friends of the Park group to assist in raising money for the park.\n\n-01 introduced by Ms. Terry Broussard and seconded by Ms. Roslyn White to install a four-way stop sign at the intersection of Maude and Dutel.

The motion carried unanimously.\n\n-05 introduced by Ms. Roslyn White and seconded by Mr. Francis Plaisance to award the contract for asbestos removal at 1507 Franks Alley to American pollution Control, Inc. in the amount of $5,610.00 and to table any action on awarding the contract for demolition at this time. The motion carried unanimously.\n\nMayor Mark Piazza\nWas disappointed with the turnout for the Martin Luther King Day parade. Maybe we can sit with the Committee and try to get it revitalized.\n\n\n\n\nCouncilman Francis Touchet, Jr.\nAsked Clay when we will switch back to two days a week for grass cutting. Clay stated we will keep that schedule until the grass starts growing but we can switch that whenever the Council wishes. Mayor Piazza stated that if we miss a day because of rain we should catch that up on Friday unless there is other work planned.\n\nCouncilman Francis Plaisance\nIs concerned about our boundaries. Maurice is coming this way. Asked if Mr. Gene Sellers can come up with some suggestions. Mr. Gene stated that the only thing we could do is approach the landowners to see if they are interested. Mayor Piazza stated that Maurice has been annexing undeveloped property. You can?t make someone annex their property if they don?t want to. Ike Funderburk stated a forced annexation has to have City all the way around and requires an election of the people in the City and those who are impacted by it. You have to carry both. Mayor Piazza stated that existing businesses and areas have to want to be annexed. You can?t force them to do that. The vacant property is a little different because their incentive it to help them develop the property. Cities go and negotiate with them to bring utilities and other City services.\n\nCouncilman Brady Broussard, Jr.\nToday was Annual Government Day for some of our brightest students who take over parish government for a day. That cannot be accomplished without the support and the sponsorship of our local American Legion. This is a program that goes back decades and it was great to see those young people in the courthouse today interested in their local government. It gives hope that future leaders were in that group today.\nThere are good jobs available right now for our citizens who are waiting around for it to drop in their lap. The federal government is hiring hundreds of people locally for the census. The pay is $17.50 to $18.00 per hour with a laptop and cellphone. They are hired immediately. If anyone is interested, they can contact him or the Mayor.\n\nThere being no further business to discuss, Mayor Piazza declared this meeting adjourned.\n\nATTEST: APPROVE:\n\nKathleen S.

Councilwoman Broussard stated she has received several calls from neighbors and she would like to know what is in our range as to what we can do. Can we take any steps in having him remove the eyesore? Mr. Funderburk stated Charity Street is part of the Louisiana State highway system. We cannot regulate parking on that street. That is done by the State of Louisiana. If they do not want people parking there, then they have the capability to regulate that. We have been told on more than one occasion, by DOTD, that we cannot regulate parking on their highways. Mayor Piazza stated that some of the issue is the farm machinery and equipment. Do we have anything City wide about that? Mr. Funderburk stated all we have are prohibitions from 18-wheelers parking in residential areas. That is the only restriction he is aware of. The vehicles are all licensed and registered so those are legal to be parked in front of somebody\ufffds house. Councilwoman White suggested that we could reach out to Bill Oliver, with DOTD, and tell him we are having complaints about this. Councilman Plaisance stated there is also a mangled building on the property. Clay Menard stated that he would contact Randy with the local DOTD office and get back with Councilwoman Broussard and Ike. The property owner is definitely parked in DOTD\ufffds right-of-way. Mr. Funderburk stated the vehicles and tractors are being utilized. Councilman Broussard stated the tractor is junked and it does not work. It was dumped there on a trailer. He collects this stuff. Councilwoman White stated that it is possible that he is doing mechanic work there. Clay stated this guy used to live on Alleman Street. He is a farmer. Councilwoman Broussard stated she would get with Sarah about the mangled building.\n\nCouncilwoman Broussard discussed the upcoming Martin Luther King Day activities. The theme for 2020 is Embracing the Dream and Celebrating Unsung Heroes. The t-shirt with the theme will be available beginning January 13th.

K. Stevens. The annual Martin Luther King, Jr. breakfast is Saturday, January 18, 2020. Doors will open at 8:30 AM and breakfast begins at 9:00 AM.

The appraisal came back at $19,000 and the purchase price is $16,900. It is a good investment for our citizens. Ms. Claire Broussard stated this is a benefit for the Park and the City. We would like to add canoeing to the park and it would be a good amenity to add. Parks that have more amenities are more popular. Councilwoman White added that they were able to investigate the property and walk all the way to the water. Councilman Plaisance stated that this is a good asset for the City. He asked who we are purchasing the property from, who is responsible for clearing the land and the cost of a dock and where will be get the funds for that. Mr. Funderburk stated we are purchasing the property from the heirs of F. N. Hollier. He will get an abstract of the property and he will make contact with the realtor. It is his understanding that this property would be left as a wilderness area so it would not be cleared other than what is necessary for the walking trails. Councilwoman White stated that this is a revenue producing park and the plan is that we will negotiate with the current management of the park to renegotiate their lease. In the renegotiation we will discuss who will be responsible for what expenses and what the actual plan for building it out will be. At this point, the plan is to purchase the property and then sit down with the management of the RV Park since it is them that will be planning it out and producing the revenue then paying the City back. Councilman Plaisance stated that when we renegotiate the lease, we need to do better than what we are doing now which is 2 \ufffd %. Councilwoman White stated that there will be a plan in place before any progress on the property starts. Right now, we want to secure the property and then come up with a plan and negotiate the lease to incorporate it into the RV Park. Ms. Claire Broussard stated that she recently found out from Charlene Beckett that there are a lot of grants out there to give access to waterfront property. Councilman Broussard stated that ecotourism is huge and growing. To bring those types of people to our community and their dollars in our restaurants would be a good thing and he hopes we can take it to its full potential. The market is there. Councilwoman White stated there is a huge opportunity to start a canoeing trail from Lafayette down Coulee Kinney to Abbeville RV Park and then down to Palmetto State Park. That is huge right now and it is a growing market. We are located at a great stopping place and it will bring people to our restaurants. You can do bike rentals there so they can bike into town. It will be a huge growth opportunity for Abbeville. Ms. Claire Broussard stated she has been in contact with someone from Pack and Paddle. They have been very helpful. Mr. Funderburk stated the City owns the Park and there is a management agreement between the City and Monar. We have a management agreement and not a lease.\n\nWhite/T.

Mr. Pillette stated that he has accumulated a lot of equipment that is located on the property. He is trying to clear it but he has a tight work schedule to maintain. He is requesting more time to get the property cleaned. He has begun clearing it but didn\ufffdt realize how much stuff he had that he has to sort out. Mayor Piazza asked if he has somewhere behind his house where he could move the stuff. Mr. Pillette stated he has a tool shed in back. It was a beauty shop but he is using it as a tool shed. Councilwoman White stated that she does drive by there quite a bit. That road is very narrow and you have a lot of stuff on our right-of-way. There are abandoned cars on our right-of-way which makes is a very narrow road for cars to pass in front of your house. She is asking, at a minimum, to remove everything off of the right-of-way and she would like Mr. Pillette to tell her how long of an extension he would need. She does see him working but it is very hard to see progress because there is so much accumulation. Mr. Pillette stated that he would like as much time as they can give him because he has a rigorous work schedule being a plumber and an electrician. He has a lot of indebtedness that he is facing right now with certification and licenses. He is constantly trying to continue his work schedule while still trying to sort our and clear the accumulation. Mayor Piazza stated that we have already had the hearing and we have already received bids to clean up the property. The reason we have already had the hearing and ordered the property to be cleaned is because this is not something that has occurred in the last couple of months. This violation goes back several months. We gave you all year last year to clean the property. This is not something that is new. You started getting letters on that property last summer. You have had several months to clean the property but you did not do anything. You didn\ufffdt start cleaning until I went to your house during the Christmas holidays and pleaded with you to work with the Council and clean the mess up. For months you sat there and did absolutely zero. Mr. Pillette stated the Mayor is right but he needs the proper amount of time to get it cleaned up. He is asking for more time to clean it up. Councilwoman Broussard asked Mr. Pillette if there is someone who is willing to work with him to assist him in getting this cleaned up. There are several young men who would like to help. Mr. Pillette stated that he appreciates the offer but, in the rubbish, he has equipment mixed in. He has fittings and parts that he has to keep. He has to sort out everything himself. His work schedule is preventing him from doing this quickly. Councilman Plaisance stated that he has been on the Council for 13 \ufffd years and that property has been like that for at least that long. Please help us by getting this cleaned up. Mr. Pillette stated if he gets more time, he will be sure to get it cleaned up satisfactorily. Councilwoman White stated that if the property is not cleaned up by the next City Council meeting then we will move forward.\n\nThere being no further business to discuss, Mayor Piazza declared this meeting adjourned.\n\nATTEST:APPROVE:\n\nKathleen S.

Go a safe distance away upwind of the gas smell and call the Town. With any gas leak protect life first then property, then notify the Town.\n\nExcavator Procedure:\nPipeline markers are maintained to inform the public of the gas line location. State and federal laws require excavators to notify b..A One-Call two (2) full working days before digging. If any excavation is planned, you must notify LA One-Call which will notify the City to locate the gas lines. The Town of Clayton maintains membership in the LA One-Call program.\n\nEmergency Contact Information:\nTo obtain additional information or report a gas-related issue call the Town of Clayton. The Town of Clayton phone number is 318-757-8540 or call 318-437-5422 (24 hours).The LA One-Call Center phone number is 811 .

The Issuer, through its Governing Authority, covenants to fix, establish and maintain such rates and collect such fees, rents or other charges for the services and facilities of the System, and all parts thereof, and to revise the same from time to time whenever necessary, as will always provide revenues in such year sufficient to pay the reasonable and necessary expenses of operating and maintaining the System in such year, the principal and interest falling due on the Bonds in such year, all reserve and sinking fund and other payments required for such year by this Ordinance and all other obligations or indebtedness payable out of the revenues of the System for such year, and which will provide revenues in each year, after paying all reasonable and necessary expenses of administering, operating and maintaining the System in such year, at least equal to 120% of the largest amount of principal and interest maturing in any future fiscal year on the Bonds and on any Parity Obligations hereafter issued as provided herein in any future year. The Issuer further covenants:\n\nThat all of the income and revenues derived or to be derived by the Issuer from the operation of the System shall be deposited as the same may be collected in a separate and special bank account heretofore established and maintained with the regularly designated fiscal agent bank of the Issuer, and designated as the \ufffdElectric Utility System Fund\ufffd(the \ufffdRevenue Fund\ufffd), said Fund to be maintained and administered in the following order of priority and for the following express purposes:\n\n(a) The payment of all reasonable and necessary expenses of operating and maintaining the System.\n\n(b) The establishment and maintenance of the \ufffdElectric Utility Revenue Bond and Interest Sinking Fund\ufffd (the \ufffdSinking Fund\ufffd), sufficient in amount to pay promptly and fully the principal of and the interest on the Bonds and any Parity Obligations issued hereafter in the manner provided by this Ordinance by transferring from the Revenue Fund to the fiscal agent of the Issuer monthly in advance on or before the 20th day of each month of each year, a sum equal to the principal and interest accruing on said debt obligations for such calendar month together with such additional proportionate sum as may be required to pay said principal and interest as the same respectively become due. If Parity Obligations are hereafter issued by the Issuer in the manner provided in this Ordinance, moneys in the Sinking Fund shall be equally available to pay principal and interest on such Parity Obligations. Said fiscal agent bank shall transfer from the Sinking Fund to any paying agent or pay directly to the registered owner, for all bonds payable from the said Sinking Fund, at least one (1) day in advance of the date on which each payment of principal or interest falls due, funds fully sufficient to pay promptly the principal and/or interest so falling due on such date.\n(c) The establishment and maintenance of the \ufffdElectric Utility Revenue Bond Reserve Fund\ufffd (the \ufffdReserve Fund\ufffd), by transferring from the Revenue Fund to the Reserve Fund monthly in advance on the 20th day of each month, commencing the first month following the completion of the Project, a sum at least equal to twenty percent (20%) of the amount to be paid in such month into the Sinking Fund, the payments into the Reserve Fund to continue until such time as there has been accumulated therein a sum equal to the Reserve Fund Requirement. The money in the Reserve Fund shall be retained solely for the purpose of paying the principal and interest on the Bonds and any Parity Obligations as to which there would otherwise be default. In the event that Parity Obligations are issued, then such payments shall be resumed until such time as there has been accumulated in the Reserve Fund an amount of money equal to the Reserve Fund Requirement.\n\n(d) The establishment and maintenance of the \ufffdElectric Utility Depreciation and Contingency Fund\ufffd (the \ufffdContingency Fund\ufffd), to care for extensions, additions, improvements, renewals and replacements necessary to operate properly the System, by transferring from the Utilities System Fund to the regularly designated fiscal agent bank of the Issuer (or such other bank designated by the Issuer), monthly in advance on or before the 20th day of each month of each year, commencing the first month following the completion of the Project, a sum equal to five percent (5%) of the amount to be paid in such month into the Sinking Fund until $200,000 is on deposit in the Contingency Fund. Should the funds in the Contingency Fund be reduced to an amount less than $200,000, said monthly payments shall recommence until a sum of $200,000 is on deposit therein, provided such sum is available after provision is made for the payments required under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above. Money in the Contingency Fund may also be used to pay the principal of and the interest on the Bonds and any Parity Obligations for the payment of which there is not sufficient money in the Sinking Fund or the Reserve Fund, but if so used, such money shall be replaced by the Issuer as soon as possible thereafter out of the earnings of the System after making the required payments into the respective funds and accounts hereinabove set out.\n\nSubject to the foregoing, which are cumulative, the balance of the excess funds on deposit in the Revenue Fund and/or the Contingency Fund may be used by the Issuer for the purpose of calling and/or paying bonds payable from the income and revenues of the System or for such other lawful corporate purposes as this Governing Authority may determine, whether or not such purposes are or are not related\nto the System.\n\nIf at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys in the Reserve Fund or the Contingency Fund for the purpose of paying principal of or interest on bonds payable from the Sinking Fund as to which there would otherwise be default then the moneys so used shall be replaced from the revenues first thereafter received, not hereinabove required to be used for operation and maintenance of the System or for current principal, interest and reserve requirements. If at any time there are sufficient moneys on deposit in the Reserve Fund and the Contingency Fund to retire all of the Bonds and any outstanding Parity Obligations payable from the Sinking Fund by defeasance, by exercising the redemption option provided by such bonds or by purchase on the open market, the Issuer may utilize such funds for such purpose.\n\nAll or any part of the moneys in the foregoing funds and accounts shall, at the written request of the Issuer, be invested in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the State of Louisiana. All income derived from such investments shall be added to the money in said respective funds or to the Revenue Fund, as appropriate, and such investments shall, to the extent at any time necessary, be liquidated and the proceeds thereof applied to the purpose for which the respective funds are herein created.\n\nSECTION 9. Deposit of Funds and Security Therefor. All of the income and revenues to be earned from the operation of the System shall be deposited promptly as provided in Section 8 hereof in the Revenue Fund, which Revenue Fund shall be maintained separate and apart from all other funds of the Issuer. The Sinking Fund, the Reserve Fund and the Contingency Fund shall be held by the depository banks as special trust funds for the purposes provided in this Resolution, and all other funds shall be held by the designated banks as special deposits for the purposes set forth in this Ordinance, and subject to such reasonable instructions as this Governing Authority may give in writing to the banks holding such funds. The Owners are hereby granted a lien on all funds established and/or maintained pursuant to the requirements of this Ordinance, except for the Contingency Fund, until applied in the manner herein provided. The moneys on deposit in all of the funds herein required shall at all times be secured to the full extent thereof as required by the laws of the State of Louisiana.\n\nSECTION 10. Rates and Charges. Except as provided herein, nothing in this Ordinance or in the Bonds shall be construed to prevent the Issuer from altering, amending or repealing from time to time as may be necessary any resolution or ordinance setting up and establishing a schedule or schedules of rates and charges for the services and facilities to be rendered by the System, said alterations, amendments or repeals to be conditioned upon the continued preservation of the rights of the Owners with respect to the income and revenues of the System, not alone for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds, but to give assurance and insure that the income and revenues of the System, together with such other lawfully available funds as are used by the Issuer for such purposes, shall be sufficient at all times to meet and fulfill the other provisions stated and specified in Section 8 of this Ordinance. It is understood and agreed, however, that the Issuer shall fix and maintain and collect rates and charges for the services and facilities to be rendered by the System, irrespective of the user thereof, that no free service shall be furnished to any Person, or even to the Issuer itself and that no discrimination shall be made as to rates and charges for the services and facilities of the System as between users of the same type or class.\n\nThe Issuer agrees that failure of any individual, partnership or corporation to pay said charges within fifteen (15) days of the date on which it is due shall cause such charge to become delinquent; that if such delinquent charge, with interest and penalties accrued thereon, is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date on which it became delinquent, the Issuer will shut off gas service to the affected premises, and that the Issuer and this Governing Authority and its officials, agents and employees will do all things necessary and will take advantage of all remedies afforded by law to collect and enforce the prompt payment of all charges made for services rendered by the System. All delinquent charges for such services shall on the date of delinquency have added thereto a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the charge, and the amount so due, including any penalty charge, may, in the discretion of this Governing Authority, after ten (10) days from the date of delinquency, bear interest at a reasonable rate to be established by the Governing Authority, which rate shall not be less than six per centum (6%) per annum. If services shall be discontinued as above provided, the customer shall, in addition to paying the delinquent charges, penalties and interest, if any, pay as a condition precedent to the resumption of service, a reasonable reconnection charge.\n\nIt is further understood and agreed that the schedule of rates, fees, rents and other charges being charged as of the date of the adoption of this Ordinance for services and facilities rendered by the System shall remain in effect and neither said existing schedule nor any subsequent schedule shall be reduced at any time unless all payments required for all funds by this Ordinance, including any deficiencies for prior payments, have been fully made, and unless such schedule as so reduced will in each year thereafter produce sufficient revenues to meet and fulfill the other provisions stated and specified in Section 9 of this Ordinance.\n\nSECTION 11. Right to Pledge Revenues; Rank of Lien. In providing for the issuance of the Bonds, the Issuer does hereby covenant and warrant that it is lawfully seized and possessed of the System, that it has a legal right to pledge the revenues of the System as herein provided, that the Bonds will have a lien and privilege on said revenues subject only to the prior payment from such revenues or from other lawfully available sources of all reasonable and necessary expenses of administration, operation and maintenance of the System and that the Issuer will at all times maintain the System in first class repair and working order and condition.\n\nSECTION 12. Records and Accounts; Audit Reports. As long as any of the Bonds are outstanding and unpaid in principal or interest, the Issuer shall maintain and keep proper books and accounts of the System separate and apart from all other records and accounts in which shall be made full and correct entries of all transactions relating to the System. Not later than six (6) months after the close of each fiscal year, the Issuer shall cause such an audit to be made by a recognized independent firm of certified public accountants, which audit shall reflect all receipts and disbursements of the Issuer, including those made for the account of the System. Such audit shall be available for inspection by the Owners and a copy of such audit shall be furnished to the Purchaser upon request. Each such audit, in addition to whatever matters may be thought proper by the accountant to be included therein, shall include the following:\n\n1. A statement in detail of the income and expenditures of the System for such fiscal year.\n\n2. A balance sheet as of the end of such Fiscal Year.\n\n3. The accountant\ufffds comments regarding the manner in which the Issuer has carried out the requirements of this Ordinance, and the accountant\ufffds recommendations for any changes or improvements in the operation of the Sys tem or the method of keeping the records relating thereto.\n\n4. A list of the insurance policies in force at the end of theFiscal Year, setting out as to each policy the amount of the policy, the risks covered, the name of the insurer and the expiration date of the policy.\n\n5. The number of metered gas customers and the number of un-metered gas customers, if any.\n\nAll expenses incurred in the making of the audits required by this Section shall be regarded and paid as a maintenance and operating expense. The Issuer further agrees that the Purchaser, the Paying Agent and any Owner shall have the right to discuss with the accountant making the audit the contents of the audit and to ask for such additional information as they may reasonably require. The Issuer further agrees that the Purchaser, the Paying Agent, and the Owners shall have at all reasonable times the right to inspect the System and the records, accounts and data of the Issuer relating thereto.\n\nSECTION 13. Rights of Owners; Appointment of Receiver in Event of Default. The Owners from time to time shall be entitled to exercise all rights and powers for which provision is made in the laws of the State of Louisiana.

Such receiver shall collect and receive all rates, fees, rentals and other revenues, maintain and operate the System in the manner provided in this Ordinance, and comply under the jurisdiction of the court appointing such receiver, with all of the provisions of this Ordinance.\n\nWhenever all that is due upon the Bonds and interest thereon, and under any covenants of this Ordinance for reserve, sinking or other funds, and upon any other obligations and interest thereon, having a charge, lien or encumbrance upon the fees, rentals or other revenues of the System, shall have been paid and made good, and all defaults under the provisions of this Ordinance shall have been cured and made good, possession of the System shall be surrendered to the Issuer upon the entry of an order of the court to that effect. Upon any subsequent default, any Owner, or any trustee appointed for Owners as hereinafter provided, shall have the same right to secure the further appointment of a receiver upon any such subsequent default.\n\nSuch receiver shall in the performance of the powers hereinabove conferred upon him be under the direction and supervision of the court making such appointment, shall at all times be subject to the orders and decrees of such court, and may be removed thereby and a successor receiver appointed in the discretion of such court.

Such receiver shall have no power to sell, assign, mortgage or otherwise dispose of any property of any kind or character belonging or pertaining to the System but the authority of such receiver shall be limited to the possession, operation and maintenance of the System for the sole purpose of the protection of both the Issuer and the Owners and the curing and making good of any default under the provisions of this Ordinance, and the title to and the ownership of the System shall remain in the Issuer, and no court shall have any jurisdiction to enter any order or decree permitting or requiring such receiver to sell, mortgage or otherwise dispose of any property of the System except with the consent of the Issuer and in such manner as the court shall direct.\n\nThe Owner or Owners in an aggregate principal amount of not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Bonds then outstanding may by a duly executed certificate appoint a trustee for the Owners with authority to represent such Owners in any legal proceedings for the enforcement and protection of the rights of such Owners. Such certificate shall be executed by such Owners, or by their duly authorized attorneys or representatives, and shall be filed in the office of the Clerk of the Issuer.\n\nUntil an event of default shall have occurred, the Issuer shall retain full possession and control of the System with full right to manage, operate and use the same and every part thereof with the rights appertaining thereto, and to collect and receive, and, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, to take, use and enjoy and distribute the earnings, income, rent, issue and profits accruing on or derivable from the System.\n\nSECTION 14. Maintenance of System, Limitations on Sale, Lease or Other Disposition of Property.

Except as hereinafter provided in Section 17 hereof, the Issuer hereby covenants that it will not voluntarily create or cause to be created any debt, lien, pledge, mortgage, assignment, encumbrance or any other charge whatsoever having priority over or a parity with the lien of the Bonds and the interest thereon upon any of the Revenues pledged as security therefor in this Ordinance.\n\nSECTION 17. Issuance of Parity Obligations; Parity Requirements. The Bonds shall enjoy complete parity of lien on the net revenues of the System despite the fact that any of the Bonds may be delivered at an earlier date than any other of the Bonds. The Issuer hereby covenants that it shall issue no other bonds or obligations of any kind or nature payable from or enjoying a lien on the revenues of the System having priority over or parity with the Bonds, except that Parity Obligations may be issued hereafter if the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The Bonds or any part thereof may be refunded and the refunding bonds so issued shall enjoy complete equality of lien with the portion of the Bonds which is not refunded, if there be any, and the refunding bonds shall continue to enjoy whatever priority of lien over subsequent issues as may have been enjoyed by the Bonds refunded, provided, however, that if only a portion of the Bonds outstanding is so refunded and if the refunding bonds require total princi pal and interest payments during any year in excess of the principal and interest which would have been required in such year to pay the Bonds refunded thereby, then such Bonds may not be refunded without the consent of the Owners of the unrefunded portion of the Bonds issued hereunder; or\n\n2. Parity Obligations may also be issued on a parity with the Bonds if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) The net revenues for (a) any consecutive twelve (12) calendar months in the eighteen (18) month period im mediately preceding the date of issuance of the pro posed Parity Obligations or (b) the fiscal year immedi ately preceding the date of issuance of such Parity Ob ligations, adjusted to reflect any increase in rates which has been adopted by this Governing Authority and which will take effect prior to a date not later than the date of the delivery of such Parity Obligations, are equal to at least 120% of the average annual debt serv ice requirements on all bonds or obligations whatso ever then outstanding which are payable from the rev enues of the System, and any Parity Obligations theretofore issued and then outstanding (but not includ ing bonds which have been refunded or provision oth erwise made for their full and complete payment and redemption), and the Parity Obligations so proposed to be issued; provided, however, that this limitation may be waived or modified by the written consent of the owners of the Bonds then outstanding. (Junior and subordinate bonds may be issued without restriction). In making the calculation set out in this paragraph it will not be necessary to include in any calculation future in terest payments to be paid from capitalized interest.\n\n(b) The payments required to be made into the various funds provided in Section 8 hereof must be current.\n\n(c) The existence of the facts required by paragraphs (a) and (b) above must be determined by the chief finan cial officer of the Issuer.\n\n(d) The proceeds of the additional bonds must be used solely for the making of improvements, extensions, renewals, replacements or repairs to the System or to refund the Bonds or any Parity Obligations.\n\nSECTION 18. Fidelity Bonds. So long as any of the Bonds are outstanding and unpaid, the Issuer, in operating the System, shall require all of its officers and employees who may be in a position of authority or in possession of money derived from the operation of the System, to obtain or be covered by a blanket fidelity or faithful performance bond, or independent fidelity bonds written by a responsible indemnity company in amounts adequate to protect the Issuer from loss.\n\nSECTION 19. Retention and Duties of Consulting Engineer in Event of Failure to Make Required Payments. The Issuer covenants and agrees that in the event it should fail to derive sufficient income from the operation of the System to make the required monthly payments into the funds established by Section 9 hereby, it will retain a Consulting Engineer (the \ufffdEngineer\ufffd) on a continuous basis until all defaults are cured, for the purpose of providing for the Issuer continuous engineering counsel in the operation of its System. Such Engineer shall be retained under contract at such reasonable compensation as may be fixed by this Governing Authority, and the payment of such compensation shall be considered to be one of the costs of maintaining and operating the System. Any Engineer appointed under the provisions of this Section may be replaced at any time by another Engineer appointed or retained by the Issuer, with the consent and approval of the original Purchaser of the Bonds.\n\nThe Engineer shall prepare within ninety (90) days after the close of each Fiscal Year a comprehensive operating report, which report shall contain therein or be accompanied by a certified copy of an audit of the preceding Fiscal Year prepared by the Issuer's certified public accountants, and in addition thereto, shall report upon the operations of the System during the preceding Fiscal Year, the maintenance of the properties, the efficiency of the management of the System, the proper and adequate keeping of books of record and account, the adherence to budget and budgetary control provisions, the adherence to the provisions of this Ordinance and all other things having a bearing upon the efficient and profitable operation of the System, and shall include whatever criticism of any phase of the operation of the System the Engineer may deem proper, and such recommendations as to changes in operations and the making of repairs, renewals, replacements, extensions, betterments and improvements as the Engineer may deem proper.

In any case where notice to Owners is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice to any particular Owner, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to all other Bonds. Where this Ordinance provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Owner or Owners entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Owners shall be filed with the Paying Agent, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.\n\nSECTION 26. Cancellation of Bonds. All Bonds surrendered for payment, redemption, transfer, exchange or replacement, if surrendered to the Paying Agent, shall be promptly canceled by it and, if surrendered to the Issuer, shall be delivered to the Paying Agent and, if not already canceled, shall be promptly canceled by the Paying Agent.

Any constitutional or statutory provisions enacted after the date of this Ordinance which validate or make legal any provision of this Ordinance and/or the Bonds which would not otherwise be valid or legal, shall be deemed to apply to this Ordinance and to the Bonds.\n\nSECTION 28. Discharge of Ordinance; Defeasance. If the Issuer shall pay or cause to be paid, or there shall otherwise be paid to the Owners, the principal of and interest on the Bonds, at the times and in the manner stipulated in this Ordinance, then the pledge of the money, securities, and funds pledged under this Ordinance and all covenants, agreements, and other obligations of the Issuer to the Owners shall thereupon cease, terminate, and become void and be discharged and satisfied, and the Paying Agent shall pay over or deliver all money held by it under this Ordinance to the Issuer.\n\nPrincipal installments or interest installments for the payment or redemption of which money shall have been set aside and shall be held in trust (through deposit by the Issuer of funds for such payment or otherwise)at the maturity date thereof shall be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed above in this Section if they are defeased in the manner provided by Chapter 14 of Title 39 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, as amended.\n\nSECTION 29.

The motion was unanimously adopted.\n\n3. Chairman Jeff Naquin recognized the Secretary-Treasurer, who stated that an email was received and forwarded to each Juror from some of the owners of the Shell Beach Boat Landing. She advised that it stated that due to the condition of the launch and the liability associated with it they considered closing the facility. She then stated that they (37%) of the owners proposed to lease it to the Parish at $1,000 a month on a month to month basis. It also stated that if the Parish choses not to accept, they will be forced to close it. Police Juror Myron Matherne requested the reason only 37% is requesting the lease.\nChairman Jeff Naquin recognized Sid Marchand, who stated that they believe the remaining owners will go along with the request but they are not waiting. In response, committee member Myron Matherne stated that it?s a bit much for a lease when other launches receive $200. He also stated that the launch is not in the best condition, the liability, etc. Chairman Jeff Naquin stated that the ADA is not present to chime in but with only 37% of the owners and a month to month lease, the Parish will not sign a contract. He added that for the Parish to commit it would have to be with 100% ownership and a long term, 15-20 yr. lease proposal. Committee member Irving Comeaux reiterated that none of the other launches are receiving that amount.\nShane Guillot suggested that the Jury discuss the matter and present a proposal and/or negotiate a counteroffer, offer a short-term lease and purchase later. Sid Marchand informed the committee that Shane Guillot would be the contact person for further discussion or negotiations.\nPolice Juror Leroy Blanchard stated that his concern regarding this launch is the size of the property for a parking lot and launch. Following the discussion, chairman Jeff Naquin stated that no action would be made tonight but the Parish will look into seeking grants that may assist with the purchase. In response, the Secretary-Treasurer stated that the Jury would have to decide where would the money come from to do anything (maintenance, upgrade, etc.) regarding the launch. In response the Secretary-Treasurer stated the funds are budgeted through General Fund. She also stated that recreation funds are budgeted through general fund and those funds cover the utilities.\n\n4. Chairman Jeff Naquin stated that the Parish received a request from the AARC in the latter part of last year for a 4% increase and the Jury decided to take no action and renew for 2 months into 2020. He stated that in conversation with a representative of the AARC, the recycling is running into a deficit He then stated that in 2019 the AARC recycled 300 tons of debris which saves some cost that would have been hauled to the landfill. In response to whether it?s a requirement, the Secretary-Treasurer stated that the ADA informed that the current law that initiated this program is still in effect however, in addition to it being severely outdated, he was unable to find any real imposition outside of the word encouragement. In addition, he stated it was stated broadly enough to include flexibility and whenever economically feasible. He also asked if we, the Parish, submits any reporting to the State, and the answer is no but the AARC does. He further stated that if they are operating at a deficit annually, he cannot find any real imposition that would force the Parish to continue in this fashion. With that being stated, if the Parish provides reporting data of some kind to a State Agency, it would certainly behoove us to contact them directly for a formal opinion.\nChairman Jeff Naquin recognized Mr. Larry Boudreaux, 25+ yrs. Board Member, who stated that this program is not only about recycling and saving money, it?s about the people that perform the work. He stated that they are very proud of the work that the men and women do for the parish and it needs to be taken into consideration. He also stated that it?s not cost, it?s about what is being done for the individuals that may not be able to do anything else. He then invited the Jurors to come and visit to see what goes on and how impressed they would be. A brief discussion was held regarding the 4% and if the AARC could operate without it. Following the discussion, the Jury agreed to submit the 2019 rate for this year.\n\n5. Committee member Irving Comeaux offered a motion, seconded by Mr. Ron Alcorn, ?THAT, the committee approve the renewal contract with the AARC at the 2019 rate.? The motion was unanimously adopted.\n\n6. Chairman Jeff Naquin recognized the Secretary-Treasurer, who stated that the renewal contract for the APCC Chiller Maintenance is with the same terms and agreements as last year. She then recommended approval. In response, she stated that there is no one local that has the equipment.\n\n7. Committee member Michael Dias offered a motion, seconded by Mr. Myron Matherne, ?THAT, the committee approve the renewal contract with Direct Parts & Services for the APCC Chiller Maintenance.? The motion was unanimously adopted.\n\n8. Chairman Jeff Naquin recognized the Parish Manager, who stated that LA Parish Engineers Supervisors Association is an organization that allows the Parish Managers to meet and network.\n\n9. Committee member Ron Alcorn offered a motion, seconded by Mr. Chris Carter, ?THAT, the committee approve the Parish Manager to join the LA Parish Engineers Supervisors Association at $100 annually.? The motion was unanimously adopted.\n\n10. Committee member Chris Carter offered a motion, seconded by Mr. Ron Alcorn, ?THAT, the committee approve to add supplemental pay for ADA Maeghen King to replace Joni Buquoi.? The motion was unanimously adopted.\n\n11. Chairman Jeff Naquin recognized the Secretary-Treasurer, who stated that the IRS regulation relative to vehicle allowances and a taxable benefit to employees who take vehicles home. She stated that the Parish has not been abiding but the time has come to put into practice. She explained that the use of the vehicle is non-compensated pay and stated it?s a benefit. She then explained what is expected by the IRS and stated the formula requires a charge of $1.50 for every route ($3 round trip). This allowance is placed on their W-2 and is treated as taxable income. We are not interested in pulling vehicles however, the time has come to implement this regulation and give the employees the option at the beginning of this year. The Secretary-Treasurer then gave a listing of the emergency vehicles or positions that were exempt from this regulation. She stated that there is a clause that states even if an employee takes a vehicle home due to being on call, that does not constitute as an emergency vehicle and doesn?t exempt them from the charge. A brief discussion was then held regarding the vehicle regulations by the IRS and the cost. Following the discussion, the committee authorized the Parish Manager and the Secretary-Treasurer to meet with those individuals and explain the IRS regulations regarding taking a vehicle home.\n\n12. Chairman Jeff Naquin recognized the Secretary-Treasurer, who stated that there is a shortage of volunteers within the fire departments and it sometimes makes the response time a little delayed or restricted depending on the time of day. She stated that #7 in the contract was a little bit demanding and the departments were having concerns about the verbiage because they can only respond within their availability. She then stated that Police Juror Leroy Blanchard spoke with the ADA regarding the concerns and the other departments to see if the revised verbiage was acceptable. In response, Police Juror Leroy Blanchard stated that he spoke with every department other than Bayou L?Ourse because they had already signed their contract. He added that the departments were awaiting the revised language to be included.\n\n13. Committee member Michael Dias offered a motion, seconded by Mr. Ron Alcorn, ?THAT, the committee approve and accept the revised language for the Fire Protection contracts.? The motion was unanimously adopted.\n\n14. Committee member Myron Matherne offered a motion, seconded by Mr. Irving Comeaux, ?THAT, there being no further business to come before the Finance Committee, the meeting be adjourned.?

John Bel Edwards\ufffd administration\non Friday filed a lawsuit\nagainst state Treasurer John Schroder,\ncontinuing a dispute over whether state\ngovernment should be allowed to spend\nmoney from the state\ufffds unclaimed property\nfund.\nThe fund consists of abandoned financial\nassets turned over to the state treasury\nby organizations that can\ufffdt find the owner.\nWhile the owners can claim the money\nfrom the state, the entire fund is never\nclaimed at the same time, and historically\nthe legislature has appropriated some of it\nfor government operations.\nBut Schroder is refusing to continue the\npractice, saying it isn\ufffdt the state\ufffds money to\nspend.\nHe touts his office\ufffds efforts to return as\nmuch money as possible to the rightful\nowners, but he worries about what will\nhappen if he runs out of money to pay\nclaims.\nBut the administration says Schroder is\nattempting to usurp the legislature\ufffds constitutional\nspending authority.\n\ufffdSo far, the treasurer has simply refused\nto transfer the money, completely ignoring\nthe will of the people\ufffds elected representatives,\ntheir governor and the letter\nof the law,\ufffd Executive Counsel Matthew\nBlock said. \ufffdThe law is clear: excess revenues\nin the Unclaimed Property Fund are\nto benefit the public.\ufffd\nThe state has never failed to pay a rightful\nclaim, Block added, though Schroder\nsays he had to delay paying about $20 million\nin 2018.\nAt Friday\ufffds meeting of the legislature\ufffds\njoint budget committee, Edwards\ufffd\nCommissioner of Administration, Jay\nDardenne echoed Block\ufffds argument, saying\nthe Louisiana Supreme Court has affirmed\nthe practice and noting that some\nof the money is committed to bonds that\npay for a highway project. The administration\ufffds\nbudget proposal counts on $25\nmillion from the unclaimed property fund.\nIn an interview Friday, Schroder said he\nhadn\ufffdt yet had a chance to read the lawsuit.\n\ufffdI believe the money belongs to the citizens,\ufffd\nhe said. \ufffdNowhere in the law does\nit say we should be spending it. Whether\nwe did it for 20 years or not doesn\ufffdt make\nit right.\ufffd\nSchroder has supported legislation the\npast two years to lock up the principal of\nthe unclaimed money but allow the state\nto earn interest that could be used for\nsmall loans to local government. He said\nhe expects to work with legislators again\non similar legislation.\n\ufffdI think it\ufffds silly to file suit,\ufffd Schroder\nsaid.\nALDERMEN: Sidewalk work to cost $90,000 more\nFrom Page 1A\nnies, approved an ordinance\nto sell an old telephone system\nand rubber-stamped a\nrenewal for the city to engage\nLouisiana Agricultural\nCorp. to handle its worker\ufffds\ncompensation claims.\nOn a personnel front, aldermen\nreappointed Sandra\nHenderson to the city\ufffds\nBoard of Adjustments and\nreappointed David Michael\nBishop Jr. to the city\ufffds Planning\nCommission. Both\nappointments were for\nfive-year terms, beginning\nMarch 1.\nThe Board of Aldermen\ncontinued its monthly review\nof properties throughout\nthe city that have been\nidentified by code enforcement\nofficer Marie Knight\nas possibly dangerous for\ninhabitants as well as the\ngeneral public. Acting on\nKnight\ufffds recommendations,\naldermen condemned\ndwellings at 107 N. Stewart\nSt. and 203 Church St.\nCity attorney Doug Caldwell\noffered aldermen two\nordinances to approve that\nsimply clarified language in\nexisting ordinances. Aldermen\nalso introduced an ordinance\nto be approved next\nmonth that would grant Entergy\na right-of-way to extend\na new powerline to the\nIke Hamilton Expo Center.\nIn the public works arena,\naldermen approved an\nordinance for the city to\ncontinue participating in\nthe Environmental Protection\nAgency\ufffds Municipal\nWater Pollution Prevention\nProgram and another ordinance\nfor the city to contract\nwith EDKO LLC to combat\nvegetation on city property\nthat cannot be mowed.\nCity engineer Robbie\nGeorge informed the Board\nof Aldermen about the progress\non the new Black Bayou\nlift station, the Plum Street\nsewer lift station project\nand the 4th Street rehabilitation\nproject.\nAldermen signed off on\na 30-day extension for the\nBlack Bayou lift station\nproject as well as an additional\n$12,500 in cost overruns.\nAldermen accepted\nthe Plum Street sewer lift\nstation and the 4th Street\nrehabilitation projects as\nsubstantially complete.\nThey also learned the 4th\nStreet rehabilitation project\nhad been completed under\nbudget.\nOn a more expensive note,\nGeorge told the Board of\nAldermen that the sidewalk\nproject at Riverbend\nElementary School had\nencountered problems\nthat would drive the cost\nof the project up by some\n$90,000. George also said\nTuner & Turner Contracting\nwould need additional 30\ndays to complete the sidewalk\nproject.\nGeorge identified the\nproblems as replacing culverts\nat 8th Street as well as\nother endeavors to improve\ndrainage near the school.\nSomewhere in Time\nA Collector\ufffds Market\nCome & browse a large variety of items!\nVickie\nCrain\nOwner\nThe Board of Aldermen\nwill meet in a special-called\nmeeting on Monday, March\n9 beginning 5:30 p.m. Aldermen\nusually meet on\nthe second Tuesday of each\nmonth, but for March, the\nmeeting was moved to the\nsecond Monday.\nOpen 9 am-4pm\nMonday, Wednesday\nThursday, Friday\nand Saturday\n1017 N. 4th St., Monroe \ufffd 318-235-1121\nPUBLIC NOTICES\nADVERTISEMENT FOR BIDS\nSealed bids will be received by the City of West Monroe for the construction\nof the project described as follows:\nPROJECT: Ike Hamilton Expo Electrical Expansion Buildings B,C,and\nD\nTYPE: Electrical Work\nCONTRACT TIME: 90 Calendar Days\nLIQUIDATED DAMAGES: $200 (Two hundred) per Calendar Day\nProposals shall be addressed to the City of West Monroe and delivered\nhere to the office of the City Clerk, located in the City Hall, not later\nthan 10:00 a.m. on March 9, 2020.

On October 8, 2019\nthe Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) performed a detailed inspection\nand engineering evaluation of our water system called a sanitary\nsurvey. During this sanitary survey, they identified two significant deficiencies\nin our system. As our customers, you have a right to know what\nhappened and what we are doing to correct this situation. According to\nEPA\ufffds Ground Water Rule, we were required to correct the deficiencies or\nwork with the State to develop a plan to correct the deficiencies. However,\nwe failed to correct the deficiencies or contact the State before the established\ndeadline and have therefore violated a requirement of the Ground\nWater Rule.\nWHAT SHOULD I DO?\nThere is nothing you need to do. You do not need to boil your water or\ntake other corrective actions. If a situation arises where the water is no\nlonger safe to drink, you will be notified within 24 hours.\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN?\nThis is not an emergency. If this had been an emergency, you would have\nbeen notified within 24 hours.\nThe significant deficiencies has the potential to result in lack of proper\ntreatment and oversight of the water system. Inadequately treated or\ninadequately protected water may contain disease-causing organisms.\nThese organisms can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, cramps,\nand associated headaches. While we have not detected any evidence of\ncontamination or other health threats related to our source water, we are\nstill committed to correcting the deficiencies to eliminate the threat of\ncontamination.\nWHAT WAS DONE?\nViolations: (1): LDH stated that all well sites must have a generator on\nsite. In recent months, SWOW has been seeking information regarding\ngrants for generators. We have been unable to qualify for a grant. Bids\nwere obtained in December for a generator. Approval to purchase this\ngenerator was granted by the Board of Directors at the January 13, 2020\nBoard Meeting. A generator for the Larry Henry Rd. well site was ordered\non January 14, 2020 at a cost of $39,619. The concrete pad was poured at\nthe site in early February. The estimated date for installation of generator\nis March 27 2020.\n(2): LDH stated that SWOW has adopted a cross-connection control\nprogram. However, the program has not been fully enforced. SWOW has\nengaged the assistance of an outside firm to assist in implementing and\nenforcing the cross-connection control program. This program should be\nimplemented and enforced by March 27, 2020.\nPlease share this information with all the other people who drink this\nwater, especially those who may not have received this notice directly (for\nexample, people in apartments, nursing homes, schools, and businesses).\nYou can do this by posting this notice in a public place or distributing copies\nby hand or mail.\nFor more information, please contact Tommy Joe Carter, 318-325-3371,\n1840 Highway 3033, West Monroe, LA. 71292.\nRE: Safe Drinking Water Act: Notice of Violation/Tier 2 Public Notification,\nGWR Treatment Technique Violation for Failure to Correct Significant\nDeficiency, Southwest Ouachita Waterworks, Inc.\nDate Distributed: Ouachita Citizen, February 13, 2020.\n2/13\n_____________________________________________\nNOTICE\nExecutive Department\nProclamation Number 15 JBE 2020\n_________\n_________\nSPECIAL ELECTION \ufffd Associate Justice, 4th Supreme Court District\nof Louisiana, Parishes\nof Bienville, Caldwell, Catahoula, Claiborne, Concordia, East Carroll,\nFranklin,\nGrant, Jackson, LASALLE, Lincoln, Madison, Morehouse, Ouachita,\nRapides, Richland,\nTensas, Union, West Carroll, and Winn\n_________\n_________\nWHEREAS, a vacancy will exist in the office of Associate Justice,\n4th Supreme Court District of Louisiana, Parishes of Bienville, Caldwell,\nCatahoula, Claiborne, Concordia, East Carroll, Franklin, Grant, Jackson,\nLaSalle, Lincoln, Madison, Morehouse, Ouachita, Rapides, Richland, Tensas,\nUnion, West Carroll, and Winn, due to the resignation of the Honorable\nMarcus Clark, effective June 30, 2020; and\nWHEREAS, Louisiana Revised Statute 18:621 requires the Governor\nto call a special election to fill the vacancy in an existing judgeship\nwhen more than twelve (12) months of the term remain unexpired, in accordance\nwith the provisions of La.
