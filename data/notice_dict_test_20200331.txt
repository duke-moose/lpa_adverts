The Honorable Juanita Woods, Chairman, called the meeting to order. She then asked the Clerk to call the roll. There were present: Council members Harvey, Ezernack, Woods, Wilson and Clark (Mr. Clark entered the meeting at 6:05pm.) There was absent: None. The Honorable Juanita Woods, presiding officer, declared a quorum was present and asked Marshal Wince Highshaw to lead the invocation and pledge. The Honorable Juanita Woods, presiding officer, then stated the object of the meeting; that being to consider: (1) The 2020/21 fiscal year budget submitted by the Administration for review by the Council in Budget Hearing #1. Mr. Danny Richards, Budget Officer, gave the opening statement of the proposed budget for the fiscal year 2020/2021 and welcome all those in attendance and thanked the Mayor's Office, the City Departments and Division Heads, the Monroe City Marshal's Office and the Monroe City Court for their input and assistance in creating the proposed budget. For the General Fund, the Administration proposed a $61.1 million operating budget. This is a structurally balanced budget, which simply means recurring expenditures are funded solely by recurring revenues. This proposed budget does not use any of our operating reserves. The total fund balance is $14.1 million, which includes about $400 thousand in non-spendable. Unassigned fund balance of $13.7 million and the ratio of unassigned fund balance to estimated operating expenditures is 22.5%, so we have a healthy fund balance. For the Revenue Fund, the estimate is $61.1 million and there are several categories, but the 3 largest sources are: Sales Tax, the estimate for FY 2021 is $37.36 million. Property Tax, the estimate for FY 2021 is $7.9 million, mainly due to decrease in property values of 0.2%. For Fees & Charges, the estimate is $6.3 million with a decrease of 1.5%, which include these three largest sources Sanitation Fees, Entergy Services Settlement and Sale Tax Handlin Fees. The total Revenue from all sources is $61.1 million with a decrease of 0.4% over the current year estimate of 61.3 million. For the Expenditures the total is $61.1 million, a decrease of 0.8% over the current year estimate of $16.6 million. The Personnel changes by percentage: Full-time 0.3%, Part-time -9.3% for a total of -1.0% and Full-time equivalency of -0.4%. The Budget by Major Function, the largest resources are allocated to Public Safety at 42% and this is a decrease of 0.7% over the current year estimate. The Budget by Departments: Proposed total General Fund Expenditures for FY2021 is $61,063,015 at -0.8% change from 2020. For the City Expenses, there is an overall decrease by $37 thousand. The largest expense at 1.4 million is Retiree Group Insurance, but continued savings since offering the Medicare Advantage Plan option. There are 282 active members: There are 135 below Medicare age, 106 on Medicare Advantage Plan and 41 at or above the Medicare ae but not on Medicare Advantage. The Pension Costs and other benefits are 30% of all G/F expenditures, salaries & wages are 45%. Municipal Employees' Retirement System (MERS) include all city employees except fire, police and judges. The employer rate is going up 1.75% and new rate goes into effect July 1 and the 10-month general fund impact is $167 thousand. Citywide, the financial impact is $306 thousand. The Firefighters Retirement System (FRS) will increase 4.5% and is included in the Fire Department's proposed budget. Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System (MPERS) will increase 1.25% and the Financial impact is approximately $88 thousand. The Employee contribution rate for MERS will increase from 9.5% to 10% up 0.5% and the Police and Fire will remain the same at 10%. The Enterprise Funds all 6 combined: Airport, Transit, Civic Center, Zoo, Water and Sewer are operating and non-operating revenues plus transfers are $46.2 million. Operating and non-operating expenses (including depreciation of $11.7 million) are $52.9 million. Budgeted decrease in net position for all funds combined $6.7 million. There are 26 Special Revenue Funds and the only major fund is Capital Infrastructure, Revenue source is 1% (Street improv. Sales Tax), Sales Tax estimate $15.8 million-flat compared to 2020 estimate. Interest Income estimate $275 thousand, total revenue estimated at $16 million and total expenditures estimated at $15.7 million. All 26 funds combined total revenues and other sources equal $28 million and total Expenditures and other uses equal $27.4 million. Budgeted increase in fund balance for all funds combined of $600 thousand and that concludes the budget summary. The Chairman asked if there were any questions concerning the opening statement and she asked that a copy of the opening statement be emailed to each council member. The Budgets discussed were as follows: HEARING SCHEDULE: 1.) Revenues Councilman Doug Harvey noted that the question that he did have was they are forecasting sales tax to go up and, in a year, where it looks, so far you are over your decrease so what are you expecting the growth to come from. Mr. Richard noted that for last year the actual was approximately 37.5 million and that was 2019 actual and the 2020 estimate roughly could be anywhere from 37.2, could be lower and then the current years is 37.36 so he is budgeting less compared to 2019. Ms. Woods noted that taking under consideration the decrease in sales tax how much did you go back to each of the departments and ask them to cut from what they originally proposed in their budgets. Mr. Richards noted that in the proposed budget it was a different percentage they were required to cut approximately .7% in their current year's budget. 2.) Council Councilman Wilson noted that for the new council coming on board he see there was nothing budgeted for special projects. Councilwoman Woods noted that the $100,000.00 was budgeted and the council too was asked to cut our budget and having gotten with Ms. Riley we are fairly flat and there were really no other places to cut so I authorized her to cut $45,000. 00 from the special fund. Whereas each council member would have gotten $20,000.00 and trying to comply with the request it was reduced by $9,044 and leaving each council member $10, 956.00 to spend in their perspective districts. Mrs. Rowell, Administrator also noted to Councilman Wilson that he may be seeing the zeros in the council at large area, but what they did was went ahead and budgeted it in each district that amount as appose to the lumpsum in council at large. Councilman Wilson noted so when the new council comes on, they will have the same amount. Mrs. Rowell noted that they will have the split approximately $55,000.00 between the 5. Councilman Wilson noted that he would have some concerns about that, and that budget shouldn't be cut because it is going directly to the people and we know the people are the taxpayers. It is a small amount for the districts, but he is certain they can make some amendments. Mr. Wilson noted in the local grants he see that no one applied for grants, there is no money there. Mrs. Rowell noted that a lot of times they don't know at the beginning of the year at budget time what grants are going to come through, so they generally don't budget that until they have applied for them and they work those through the amendment process. Councilman Harvey wanted to know what's the difference between the 2020 department and 2020 mayor. Mr. Richards, Budget Officer, explained that the department is what the individual department requested and once the deadline to key in all this passes the budget advances to the administration level where he will make his changes or key in information and once that is done it is advanced to the mayor's level. 3.) Court Judge Joyce and Judge Lee Councilwoman Ezernack wanted to know the difference in this budget as opposed to last year. Judge Joyce noted that it is relatively the same from last year's budget. Judge Lee noted that they aren't making any changes. Councilman Wilson asked about the state grant and where did the past grant come from. Judge Joyce noted that they got one grant for the defense program, family needs services for juvenile systems and the supreme court give a 30,000.00 grant. This really helps families. Judge Lee noted that there was originally a position at the court that when the grants came along, they were able to do that. Judge Joyce thanked Councilman Wilson for using some of his funds for the courts last year. Marshal Marshal Highshaw, Marshal January Councilwoman Woods wanted to know what's different with this budget from last year. Marshal Highshaw noted that there is no difference from last year, the budget remains the same. Councilman Wilson noted to the marshal that some of the vehicles are pretty outdated and are they looking to replace them. Marshal Highshaw noted they would love to, but they don't have the funds for that. Councilwoman Woods asked if there are grants that they can get for new vehicles. Marshal Highshaw noted that they are talking to a grant writer out of Baton Rouge that has prepared a grant for the Constable Office there. They are talking to them and he expect to meet with them next week in New Orleans for the same thing. Councilwoman Woods asked if that would include getting some new vehicles. Marshal Highshaw noted that it would be updated equipment in general bullet proof vest, cameras and the works. Councilman Harvey wanted to know where the opportunities were and where money was spent and generated additional revenue. Mrs. Rowell noted that is determined by the number of cases they serve. Councilman Harvey wanted to know if your inability to serve cases impact your revenue, and if you are going to spend money in your budget is there anything that hampers your ability to generate revenue. Marshal January noted that they get revenue from the sentencing at the courts and that would depend on what the prosecutors and judges at the courts do. Mayor Mayo noted to add to Councilman Harvey's understanding, they have a unique situation with the Marshal's Office, and they are associated with the courts. They also help us in so many different ways with security at city hall, at taxation revenue office and the annex facility. They do a great job as Councilman Wilson indicated. Mrs. Rowell also noted for clarification that they are a standalone unit in that sense, a component unit of us so they do generate their own revenues that they operate out of as well. We share responsibility and the same thing with the court. 4.) Mayor Mayor Jamie Mayo Councilwoman Woods asked if there were any changes in this budget from last year and if so what. Mr. Richards noted there was a slight pension increase and mainly the mayor's budget is a decreased budget at .7%. There were some reductions in public relations. Summer workers increased about $23,000 in the current budget and about $17,000 this year. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know who these summer workers are children or adults etc. Mr. Richards noted that there is the Green Teens, which is beautification. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know how many people we are talking about. Mrs. Rowell noted in this particular division it is about 15. Mayor Mayo noted that some are in the offices as well. Councilwoman Woods noted that this is just giving young people an opportunity to work. Councilwoman Ezernack wanted to know how many weeks they are employed for. Mr. Richards noted that it is 6 weeks. Councilman Harvey noted that we have this economic development coordinator position that was funded a little in 2017 and budgeted for in 2018. What are we outsourcing this to or who is the face of economic development if it's not that person sitting in that seat? Ultimately that is our opportunity to where we drive additional sale tax revenue etc., so if this person is not the person actively working on it then who is, money was taken out and put somewhere else it appears. Mayor Mayo noted that they have 17 different folks that they fund either directly or indirectly, the Monroe Chamber of Commerce, NLA Economic Alliance, NLEP and others. Councilman Harvey wanted to know what's that funded out of. Mrs. Rowell noted that they are under different lines some in city expense and they have partnerships with several of those organizations as well as some of the Mayor's staff has picked up some of those. (The Mayor noted that his Administrative Officer as well as himself.) Councilman Harvey wanted to know outside of himself who do you think is your face of this, because obviously someone was dedicated to it in the past. Mayor Mayo noted that as he said there are 17 of them that they provide support to like the lobbying effort with the chamber, the City pays a share and the total is $60,000 and the City pays $50,000. They pay Nova which is another. Councilman Harvey said if he calls the City of Monroe and he is looking for someone to talk to in economic development, he wanted to know who they route him to. Mayor Mayo said they will route you to him and he is always there. Most of the people that call, and they are looking for specific area to do different things we have someone who we can refer them to whether its in house or to one of our partners. Mrs. Rowell noted that the line of economic development is expensed in city expenses. Mayor Mayo also noted about the Districts, Tower Armand, 1-20, Southside Economic Dev., and Downtown and the only one that doesn't have a revenue stream is Downtown Economic Development District. In addition to what we fund in the economic development fund line item and in the administrative fund which support so many folks. There are very few funds the City doesn't support that enhances economic development. That position was cut when we projected $4.5 million deficit 6 months into 2017 along with a proposed position that was going to be doing education, that was about $100,000 altogether. 5.) Legal Angie Sturdivant, City Attorney Mrs. Sturdivant noted that her budget is the same as last year. Councilman Harvey noted that lease and rental went up. Mrs. Sturdivant noted that is their copiers and shredder services. 6.) Fire Chief Terry Williams, Monica Brown (Budget Admin.) Chief Williams said basically he has the same budget and he took a $90,000 budget cut and a 4.5% increase in pension previously mentioned at about $420,000, so basically the same budget. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know how they were going to make up for that. Chief Williams said with about 8 or 9 firefighters that he will not fund. Councilwoman Ezernack asked if those were position outstanding at this point? Chief Williams said that is correct and he just won't fill those positions, so there won't be a layoff or anything like that. Mrs. Ezernack wanted to know how long those positions have been open. Chief Williams said they just graduated a group in November or December, and they were looking to hire 13 plus. The Parish and West Monroe Fire Department was hiring at the same time and they hired them before he could. Some fail physicals and some didn't show up to follow up on their physicals etc., and out of the 17 he only got 6 or 7 and lost some of those in the recruit academy. He hired 9 and lost 3 in the academy and graduated 6. But they are starting another academy soon and they have an eligibility list. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know how long that process takes. Chief Williams noted that it is a long process about 4 to 6 months. 7.) Police Interim Chief Reginal Brown, Asst. Chief Don Bartely Chief Brown noted that his budget is the same from last year, in 2019 their budget was a little over $12,186,700 million and this year their proposed budget is $12, 739,390. Basically, their expenses from last year they absorbed that into their projection for this year. Councilwoman Woods asked about the $500,000 increase. Chief Brown noted that one of the lines was in vacation pay or retirement and there is no real way to budget for that to tell how many people will retire etc. and we used that projection to increase for 2020. Mrs. Rowell noted for clarification that is not a $500,000 increase it is a decrease from $12,739 million down to $12,652 million. Councilwoman Woods was looking at the wrong line, no increase. Councilwoman Ezernack asked if they had positions out there that they have a place holder for that is included in this budget or did you get the personnel you budgeted. Chief Brown said they are not budgeting for new personnel and they have about 130 officers at this time and they budgeted for 136, which is around the same as last year. They are to hire 3 officers right now which would put them were they were this time last year. Councilwoman Ezernack asked if their process is as long as the fire department's? Chief Brown said yes. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know when was the last time they had an academy? Chief Brown noted that they have 2 academies a year and the Sheriff's Department does one for the entire region. There were 5 hired that recently graduated in the last 8 months. Councilman Harvey asked about the ones he has under salaries and wages temporary what does that represent. Chief Brown noted that those are part-time workers. (receptionists, call takers etc.) Councilman Harvey wanted to know where we are year over year with head count because he is looking at where you were in 2017 and where you are now. You are down about 6% labor cost wise and with the cost of things like that going up he can't imagine we're in the same spot as the last 3 or 4 years. Chief Brown explained that they are at 130 officers and officer Donald Simpson noted that the total with dispatchers etc., is about 172 employees and part of the reduction was due to the loss of people through attrition and we dropped lower than expected and now they are trying to get back up. The target number is 136 officers for what we budgeted this year Councilman Harvey asked if that would put them back around the 2017 number Officer Simpson said he didn't recall if those numbers did or not. 8.) Community Affairs Mr. Robert C. Johnson Councilwoman Woods asked where are you in comparison to last year? Mr. Johnson noted that there are very few changes to his budget in comparison to last year and you can see there was over-time pay, sick leave, vacation and such which they really didn't use. The only big difference would be in their park and recreation maintenance area capital fund. Other than that, the budget is pretty much the same. Councilwoman Woods asked if he was looking to add additional staff. Mr. Johnson said their count now is about 300 plus, enterprise fund, full and part-time. Councilwoman Woods noted with this increase how many full-time he is planning to bring on. Mr. Johnson said 2 additional supervisors for the recreation centers, they plan to reorganize which has been a lot of concern and they want to make those adjustment to those concerns. The process has started, and they have been working with PUD, communicating with medical insurance companies and looking into other agencies to come in to help and also getting computers, so they have been making quite a few adjustments in the centers. Councilman Harvey asked about the maintenance he is seeing salaries and wages there. In 2018, $237,000 was spent and now budgeting at $708,000 we are looking at a 3-fold increase. Mr. Richards noted that was when those employees came from Public Works and part of the Forsythe Division was moved from out of Public Works and put under Community Affairs as the parks and recreation maintenance division. Councilman Harvey noted offsetting labor expenses there, but in 20/21 he is still seeing another $125,000. Mr. Johnson noted that there were 2 employees that came over but were not counted in the count and they had to make that adjustment. Mr. Richards noted that they stayed in Public Works budget accidentally and then they had to amend the budget to include them into Community Affairs. Councilman Harvey noted that in 20/21 under fringe benefit the group insurance almost doubles and pension is about $30,000. He wanted to know is that all from moving 2 employees over there. Mr. Richards noted that some of the vacant positions have several tiers of group insurance that go any were from zero dollars up to $60,000 if they have a family plan verse others and some of the vacant positions we budget amid tier amount considering what they have vacant at the time when they submitted their budget. Councilman Harvey noted that he was trying to figure out how adding 2 people changes that cost by $30,000. Mr. Johnson noted that he didn't think it was just the 2 people, because when you take overall those who left some of the people who were supposed to come actually either retired or left and when they were replaced, they came in with family coverage. Mrs. Rowell noted that you could easily add 2 members with family coverage at $30,000. Mr. Richards noted that each year you can change your coverage and we have people that go from family plan down to employee or vice versa, so it changes those cost. Councilman Harvey wanted to know the cost per employee, citywide. Mrs. Rowell will get that information to him. Councilwoman Ezernack noted that there are several tiers for insurance. (Mrs. Rowell said there are.) Councilman Harvey asked if they were going to spend capital there. Mrs. Rowell noted that they are trying to address their capital through another means at this point. They have a Capital Project Fund set aside and they have submitted some priority needs and they are trying to address that through that. There are some vehicles, zoo and other needs on the priority list right now as well as golf courses etc. Councilman Harvey wanted to know where that list is. Mrs. Rowell said they have a committee that reviews it and they meet regularly to go over it and they allocate funds based on their submission. The committee consist of Dan Richards, Jimmie Bryant and herself. Councilwoman Woods ask if she looks at capital projects throughout the city. Mrs. Rowell said they look at capital needs. Councilman Harvey wanted to know how that makes its way through. Mrs. Rowell explained that there is video bingo money that funds one place where the garbage and trash trucks right now are getting paid from and we borrow the money for that and some of that allocation gets to flow out to some of the other departments if money is left over. If there is money left in the General Fund, we try to allocate some of that from the prior year and move that over to the capital improvement project, capital project fund, to allocate that to projects. Councilman Harvey wanted to know how much they move out of that annually. Mrs. Rowell noted about a couple of $100,000 sometimes. Councilman Harvey wanted to know if it was pretty consistent. Mrs. Rowell said not necessarily, only if there is a little left and they feel like they can spare some. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know how much is in the Bingo fund. Mrs. Rowell noted that they bring in about $300,000 a year, it's down a little and that is used to pay lease payment for when we borrow for buying garbage and trash trucks and other equipment need etc., and that makes payments for that. a.) 6002 Civic Center Fund Dr. George Cannon, Director Mrs. Ezernack asked for a synopsis of the budget compared to last year. Dr. Cannon explained that next years budget will be basically what it is for this year. They have had to deal with the ceiling which is a little over 50 years old and they had a few issues that they had to take care of, a $50,000 electrical line under the chiller had to be repaired and another $100,000 of emergency items as well. We think we are in pretty good shape right now. We are trying to be really competitive with the other venues that are available in our community such as churches, private sectors and the university and we think we are on the right track for that. Councilwoman Ezernack asked if they have seen any increase in interest of booking. Dr. Cannon said they monitor that at all times and it's not the number of booking which is really important to us but the size of the booking that they have as well. Councilwoman Woods noted that the date of the fair moved and it's going to be October the 2nd through the 10th. Dr. Cannon explained that the Civitan Club had been wanting to make a change and they think October usually has less rain fall than September and it might be 2 or 3 degrees cooler as well too. They were able to accommodate them for this year in fact the fair will leave on the 10th of October after it's 10 day run and on the 11th they will house in the theater the Russian Ballet production of Swan Lake which will be a big arts event for the community. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know where the dollars for the emergency repairs come from. Dr. Cannon explained that there were electrical wires under the Chiller that went out and when we were repairing our road work some of that happened. They also replaced a Chiller Pump this year and our maintenance contract with Siemens which handles our maintenance work has gone up about $50,000 and will remain so for the next 3 years, because they are primarily insuring their equipment and as the equipment gets older more likely something can happen and our fees go up. Councilman Harvey wanted to know what the City's commitment to them annually. Dr. Cannon said it was $132,000 and it goes up to about $134,000 and next year we have a 3-year agreement with them this time. We went out this year before we went with Siemens and talked to other companies that might be able to do the same thing locally and away and this was the best we could do. Councilman Harvey asked if over half our repairs and maintenance is attributed to that contract. Dr. Cannon said yes and their contract for next year is not but $134,000. Councilman Harvey don't see where they are spending any capital. Dr. Cannon noted that they have some issue they have to deal with, and he don't believe that they all have been resolved at this particular point. Councilman Harvey noted that you talk about it being a 50-year old place, but we don't invest capital into it. Mrs. Rowell noted that in the past again it goes back to that capital fund that was funded through the Video Bingo fund, it originally had a lot more dollars in it than it does now because it started out many years ago where we got its first lumpsum and we dibbed half million to the zoo, the civic center got a brand new $250,000 Chiller at that time so there have been different avenues through the years that some larger capital needs have been addressed. Sometimes they reached out to Capital Infrastructure if it is a really significant need and it meets that criteria. They pretty much have to accommodate the smaller things in their budget. Dr. Cannon noted that they think the upgrades make them more viable as a possible venue for the people of the community. Councilman Harvey wanted to know what's the $600,000 depreciation expense in 2019, but not in 2020 and now back in 2021. Mr. Richards explained that gets recorded after the fiscal year is over, so it hasn't been recorded through 2020. Mrs. Rowell noted that the 2019 column is actual, and the other columns are budget, so they have not budgeted in 2020 yet. This is something we usually do at the end of the year. Councilman Harvey noted looking at most things from a budgeting standpoint mostly we are looking at cash expenses and transferring money in and we are saying we should have a $600,000 impact there. Mr. Harvey noted he is trying to make sense of that. Mrs. Rowell noted that its cash so it's not going to reflect in the transfer at all. Transfer is based strictly on cash flow. Councilman Harvey wanted to know the net on the Civic Center total fund net out against depreciation. Mrs. Rowell explained that it would change its net position if it factors in, it will have a net position change. b.) 6003 Purchase Garden & Zoo Fund Joseph Clawson, Director Councilwoman Woods wanted to know what changes they have seen from 2019 to 2020. Mr. Clawson noted that functionally nothing has changed, and they may have moved a line item here and there but the bottom-line is similar to what it was last year. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know what new and innovative things they have coming up at the zoo. Mr. Clawson noted that they need to take the old 50-year old primate building down that no longer meets the standard of animal care by USDA. They are trying to build a new Beaver Exhibit to be done in house. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know the cost to demolish this old primate building. Mr. Clawson noted that the disposal fees are estimated to be $60,000. The City can help us with the demolishing and also the National Guard may be able to help us with it too. Councilman Harvey wanted to know if there are plans for the City to currently demo it or is it something that we are able to do and have not decided or committed to do yet. Mrs. Rowell noted that she thinks they are just waiting on the weather and the money is there. Mr. Clawson said that they replaced the roof on the reptile building and now they are going to modernize the inside, the floor and ceiling. This is an inhouse project. Councilwoman Woods asked if there were any plans to do anything with the gardens? Mr. Clawson noted that they do things with the gardens, but they are in the middle of winter now and they have a gardener. They have ground employees in which they are in the process of filling full-time. They are gearing up to start the gardens now. Councilwoman Woods asked about the train. Mr. Clawson said the train is doing very well at $60,000 plus a year and the boat is doing approximately the same. Those are very valuable parts of the zoo. Councilman Harvey wanted to know what's the promoter's settlement expense line. Ms. Rowell explained that the expense line is where they have to settle out after each event there are certain expenses. Dr. Cannon noted that sometimes the settlement occurs at the end of the event promoters coming in and sponsoring an entertainment event that grosses 23 or 24 thousands dollars they have certain expenses that we charge them for like the rent, labor, kitchen uses and other, so at the end of the night that's all over you settle up based on the contract you have with them. Councilman Harvey asked margin wise what do we generally make on that. Dr. Cannon explained that they have rental for various rooms in the civic center, theater and half the arena so those are pretty set in place. What adds to that is the amount of labor it takes for us to help put the show on and that is our skilled group at the theater primarily to set up. Mrs. Rowell noted that they don't have a percent margin that they calculate, and she don't know if they have ever done a calculation on that. Councilman Harvey wanted to know how profitable they are at it. Dr. Cannon explained that when you look at all cost its probably not a new figure in a long time, but we try to be competitive with the other events competing with us and he think that they are. Some think we are a little high, but not given with what we provide, and we are competitive with the industry in this state. Mayor Mayo noted that what's not calculated in that is the out of town entertainment economic impact it has on the City and Parish; it's not included in that. Dr. Cannon noted that there will be a group coming in June that will bring 4,000 people to the arena for a 4-day conference and that will be a pretty large economic impact. Councilman Harvey noted that he agrees with how we talk about subsiding it, but at the same time we get the benefit, but you wonder what extinct we get on our investment if it's worth investing more. Mr. Clawson noted that the zoo has the promotion settlement line too, the Zoological Society has a Cooperative Endeavor with the zoo, and they are allocated so many days in the year where they get to hold events. The zoo still collects the gate receipts, but by the Cooperative Endeavor Agreement so that money is given to the Zoological Society. The promoter Settlement is payments to the Zoological for their event days. Last year for Halloween they made $500, Easter is coming up and if we have a really nice day that will bring in somewhere around $16 to $18 thousand dollars and that is highly variable as to what might come in over a year. We don't pay out any money that we don't take in for that event. Mayor asked Mr. Clawson to mention the Splash Pad. Mr. Clawson added that when they originally put in the Splash Pad it increased some of the attendants at the zoo by 40% and it has pretty much maintained that level during the summer. Councilwoman Woods asked what the fees are. Mr. Clawson noted that the fees were $6 for adults, $4.50 for children and group rates are $4.50 for adults, $2.00 for children in groups of 10 and rides are $3.00. Councilwoman Woods asked about concessions and if they get to keep the money. Mr. Clawson explained that concessions is with the Cooperative Endeavor Agreement the Zoological Society operates concessions and collects the finances, we provide the building but other than that they pay all the expenses associated with labor, food cost, etc. 9.) Public Works a) 6000 Airport Fund Ron Phillips, Director Councilwoman Woods asked Mr. Phillips to talk to us about his budget and she knows that they are selfsustained. Mr. Phillips noted that the airport budget is pretty flat this year and there are no significant changes from last year, so they can pretty much expect things to be somewhat status quo as it relates to their budget. Councilman Harvey mentioned the $3 million depreciation and he guess it's the final net depreciation charge. Mrs. Rowell said yes. b) 6001 Transit Fund Marc Keenan, Gen. Manager Councilwoman Woods asked Mr. Keenan What's different with your budget. Mr. Keenan noted that Transit's budget is basically the same as it was last year and the only difference would be on the capital side. This year they are looking at replacing the bus terminal, they are going to finish paying for the bus wash and bus replacement for the bus wash and the replacement for the terminal. The City pays 20% on a dollar and on the bus wash and the bus replacement itself the City pays 15 cents on a dollar. Councilwoman Woods asked if we were getting a new bus terminal. Mr. Keenan said that is correct, it has been before council in the past, it is a 5million dollar project and they have all the federal dollars. Councilwoman Woods asked Mr. Keenan for the record to tell everyone where it is. Mr. Keenan said it is at 207 Catalpa, it is the main transfer point for all the passengers when they go out of town and they come back in and that is the transfer point when they go from route to route. Councilwoman Woods noted and for the benefit of everyone here when do you plan to start on it. Mr. Keenan said they are looking to start in September or October. Councilwoman Woods noted that all the funds are there and the City has to pay 20%. Mr. Keenan said that is correct. Councilman Harvey noted so the city funds are reflected here. Mr. Keenan said yes, they do have a capital outlay request in for those dollars. Councilman Harvey said so it is unfunded at this point. Mrs. Rowell said that's correct as far as she knows, they haven't addendum. Mr. Keenan explained that is part of the budget, so looking on there you have about $800,000.00. Mrs. Rowell noted so you built it into your budget. Mr. Keenan said it's in the budget under professional services, and the first piece will be to hire an architect. Councilman Harvey asked how did our insurance go down so much, nobody's goes down? Mr. Keenan explained that they reduced service in 2018 and so the insurance is paid by miles and the mileage has down. Councilman Harvey noted obviously fair revenue doesn't make up a substantial portion, so how many people do we think is a beneficiary to the system. Mr. Keenan noted that they have an annual ridership and this past year it was over 700,000. It was over 1.1 million until we had to change service, so it went down and they are trying to get it built back up. Councilwoman Woods asked if they were looking at increasing the number of routes. Mr. Keenan said no, they purchased an AVL System that has some pretty good bells and whistles for advertising and marketing things that we plan on looking at doing this year. We had to stop our night service so some of the riders aren't riding the night service and we also ended during the day at 6:30pm where we use to go until 11pm. There was Sunday service some years ago. There use to be what the Federal Government call the JARC funding for reverse commute or people going to their jobs. The funding would pay us to transport them back home at night and we lost that fund in 2015 and that is why we had to make change on the night service. Councilman Harvey noted that it looks like we have cut labor cost about 25% so what does that translate to. Mr. Keenan explained that they had close to 50 employees at transit, right now they have 38 full-time employees and 1 part-time. Councilman Harvey wanted to know what that equate to route wise, less routes. Mr. Keenan explained we had 14 and now we have 10. Councilman Harvey wanted to know if the frequency schedule changed as well. Mr. Keenan noted that it was 50 minutes and it was changed to 45 minutes they are pretty much able to provide services in the same areas as before. Councilwoman Ezernack noted that you also used some smaller vehicles rather than the large buses at other none peak times. Mr. Keenan said that is correct and they are primarily for our ADA Complimentary service for the elderly and disabled who cannot ride our fixed route service. We have extra ones so we will provide them on some other routes that have low ridership. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know how many buses you are looking to replace. Mr. Keenan said next month they will have 3 new 35ft buses and in this budget, they are looking at replacing 2. They have about 4 more that needs to be replaced or that are illegible. Councilman Harvey wanted to know what we are paying per bus and he knows 15 cents on a dollar but what is our expense per bus. Mr. Keenan noted that the cost is $425,000.00 a piece total cost and we pay about $68,000.00. Further discussion followed. c) 6006 Water Fund Sean Benton, Superintendent Councilwoman Woods wanted to know what has changed with his budget for 2019 to now. Mr. Benton noted that his area consists of water treatment and distribution and with water treatment they somewhat have the same budget they had last year just with a few increases on the salary side. They are looking at adding 2 positions and assistant lab tech and a maintenance guy. We have 29 employees at the treatment plant 1 full-time and 1 part-time, also they are increasing the budget on the chemical side due to adding new equipment and new treatment process which cost about $250,000.00 annually to run. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know how long this unit to control the order and taste has been in place. Mr. Benton said they just got it put in today and Monday they will be training on it and they are waiting on last approval from the public health and hospital to move forward to combat any taste and order. Councilwoman Ezernack asked about the spraying of the bayou that Wildlife and Fishery has done in the past and she has had complaints about that, and she knows that's our water resource. She wanted to know if there was any line item to do some of that, that they are not doing or how are we going to handle that. Mr. Benton said that is also covered by the chemical budget but also some funds in his small service equipment budget as well, but with some help with delegates in this area we can get someone to talk back with Wildlife and Fishery and they have been the ones maintaining that reservoir out there. Through cutbacks they stop spraying that area and it looks like the City might be responsible for that, but the waterways are still their responsibility as a whole and with contacts in the area we can get the Wildlife and Fishery back on the team to get that done. Councilwoman Ezernack noted with this winter being light its really caused a lot of issues. Mr. Janway, Public Works Director said that he has had several conversations with Wildlife and Fishery and over the years they have responded to public pressure. There is a section of the bayou where there is no public ramp and they say their moneys for chemicals are funded through the federal government and therefore they have to use a public ramp. Councilman Harvey wanted to know how we show generating $650,000 interest income. Mrs. Rowell explained that all of their money is in one fund including the money that has just recently been drawn down for the plant improvement, bond money, so they estimate they will be drawing interest on that through the years. Councilman Harvey asked about reconnecting fee. Mr. Benton said that fee is based on turn off and turn on itself and by looking at their fire hydrant meters, which is when a resident or business comes along to get a meter for construction that cost is $1,000.00 and there is a deposit and that was not added in the year before. That is our fire hydrant meters, when a contractor gets a fire hydrant for construction. Councilman Harvey asked if we think we will generate an additional $40,000.00 plus. Mr. Benton noted that he thinks that line items the year before was put somewhere else. Councilman Harvey asked about water distribution cost under technical and professional services and it has doubled, he wanted to know what's happening. Mr. Benton explained that they are looking at doing more water distribution line projects. Councilman Harvey asked if that would be capital. Mr. Benton noted that their capital is for buying equipment dump trucks service trucks etc. d) 6008 Sewer Fund Charles Westrom, Superintendent Councilwoman Woods asked what has changed with the sewer budget. Mr. Westrom noted that they have a number of issues that have gone on in regard to expenses and one which is they have had more river events than they have ever had with the length of time the river was up and the storms that occurred. The utilities are up considerable and also their chemicals are up and land farm operations have been up which is what we take to the dumps basically. They operate 4 of the stoppage trucks and prices of those have gone up, we are due to replace 2 now. The prices of these trucks have gone up and they are a pretty big deal to maintain. Councilwoman Woods asked if the money is in this budget and trucks ordered. Mr. Westrom noted that one has just come in and that was out of this year's budget and there will be money in next year's budget to replace another one and that's in capital. Councilwoman Woods asked what else is happening. Mr. Westrom noted that as far as expenses go, they do have some significant things going on expenses wise and they are working with engineering and capital infrastructure to solve one and it seems like we will be able to go forward. Councilman Harvey noted in utilities for the water pollution control account is that actual or something driving that. Mr. Westrom noted that it is a projection based off of that actual expense and he is hoping that the utilities expenses will actually go down. They have a new digester online there that is supplying methane gas and they are generating heat for the digester using that gas as opposed to buying gas from Atmos. It has been working pretty well so far. Councilman Harvey noted that overall he sees were revenue went down slightly and what do we attribute that to. Mr. Richard, Budget Officer, explained that a lot of these sewer revenues are based on water usage and there was a reduction in water usage that is reflected in the sewer revenue. Mr. Westrom noted that these are not our final numbers they are our best guest and a lot of times at the end we see a jump, so it's an estimate. e) 7002 Central Shop Tom Janway, Public Works Director Mr. Janway noted that this is an internal service fund and it is responsible for repairing all equipment in the City with exception of fire and transit. They are responsible for keeping repaired about 1,300 pieces of equipment. The staffing levels are 15 permanent and 6 temps. With the shop rates being so low the general fund subsidies the internal fund approximately 4 to 5 hundred thousand a year. Councilman Harvey asked if that was just for fix cost absorption or what, so if we are charging out market rates and we are still having to subsidies it. Mr. Janway noted we are not at market rates they are 125 we charge 55, but it is pulling from the same pool of money. If you raise the shop rate it's just going to raise the cost to the general fund. If it were an enterprise fund such as the airport, water, sewer and you raise the shop rate then the general fund will pay less. Councilman Harvey asked if we are going to have less people, because he sees labor going down. Mr. Janway noted that they really have changed the number of personnel in the shop we just have a problem maintaining a skill workforce, so they have 6 temps at this time. Mrs. Rowell noted that it looks like some of that is a reduction in overtime, which is about what the difference is. Mr. Janway noted that sometimes it's cheaper to work temps than to hire permanents and that's why you see that in the labor area. All other funds under the direction of Public Works Tom Janway Director, Trash, Administration, Garbage, Maintenance, Construction, Beautification Drainage, Cemeteries and Streets Total number of budgeted permanent employee 60 and 35 temps. Councilwoman Ezernack wanted to know what obviously different in this presented budget as opposed to what going on now in your budget. Mr. Janway noted that there are no major differences, they received 2 new trash trucks this past fall and that has helped with the trash pickup and they are back on a weekly cycle. They will be receiving 3 new trash trucks thanks to Stacey and her efforts in April and 4 new garbage trucks. In general, looking at the public works portion of the budget repairs and maintenance is the primary thing that has gone up over the years. Councilwoman Ezernack asked when you budgeted less for that in the different divisions was it because of the new equipment or what. Mr. Janway said let's look at garbage and in 2019 they budgeted $290,000.00 and requested $230,000.00. He is projecting repairs and maintenance to be $425,000.00 and that is the equivalence of 2 garbage trucks. That give you an idea about equipment replacement and why it's so important. Councilman Wilson asked about salary wages temps being $100,000.00, he wanted to know if they are hiring more temps. Mr. Janway said yes, they are looking at trying to make all of their employees in trash permanent employees and that is the reason you see reduction in temps down to $20,000.00. You look at the increase from 235 to 336 it is a $100,000.00 increase. Councilman Wilson asked are we hiring more full-time workers. Mr. Janway said no, in trash they have 6 full-time and 6 temp employees so right now we are at 50% and we would like to hire another 6. Councilman Wilson asked how many openings we have right now for full-time. Mr. Janway said there were 45. Councilman Harvey noted this is public works as a whole. Mr. Janway said that's public works total, right and that represents 15%. Councilman Wilson asked if they were prepared to bring new people on to fill these slots. Mr. Janway said if he can hire qualified people, he will. Councilwoman Woods noted that primarily the reason you are working with the temps right now is you are using that as a screening. Mr. Janway said as a screening but also the inability to hire qualified personnel. Councilman Harvey noted the pump station maintenance amount that was requested high and ended with a low amount, he is wondering what they are not going to get to do. Mr. Janway noted that so far, they have spent over $300,000.00 and pump station repairs over the last 2 have been high because of high water conditions on the river. Councilman Harvey noted that your requests were really in line and it looks like the way we balanced this out was by pulling it away from repairs and maintenance. Mr. Janway noted that we are going to do the best with what we are given and understand that when stormwater pumps stations break, we fix them. We try to figure out where to get the money and we pull some from CIC etc. Council Harvey noted that you are telling me how much work you are doing as expensive it is and also why your repair and maintenance budget is a third half full in these categories and what it was 2 years actually. Mrs. Rowell explained that he is right, and this is one of those unknown, we have changes, they make the best that they can and we do have to sometimes hope for the best, we all try to live under our means in our budget because of the unknowns. That is a lot that we deal with and that is the reality and he is right those are expenses we can't avoid them and if from another line item in his budget and if he stays under budget that gets absorbed in his budget at the end of the year. Right now, we are operating at about 95% of our budget right now so that 5% help make up for some of those unknowns at the end of the year because we don't know. It is a plan we don't always know and if we get into a bind on something like pump stations etc., then we do sometimes have to go to the CIC commission and ask for assistance and we have had to do that in the past. Councilman Harvey noted that if we are being unrealistic with our budget and he knows they will deal with any emergency that come up but if I say I am going to spend a third of what I have been doing and say I'm doing it to make it balance, Mr. Harvey noted that he don't think Mr. Janway is being genuine with himself. Mrs. Rowell noted this is more realistic than it has been. Councilman Harvey noted that do you realistically believe that we will spend a third or a half of our repairs and maintenance on our pumps this year. Mrs. Rowell said we just don't know. Councilman Harvey noted but if we base our assumptions on historical values and unless we do something magically in the next 12 months our repair and maintenance cost would be in line. Mrs. Rowell noted that he has the option to cut something else and increase that line in his budget that is his option. Councilman Harvey noted that we are setting ourselves up for failure. Mr. Janway noted in this discussion on pump stations and Ms. Golden, Engineer, can speak to this a lot more professionally than I can. Our Calypso Pump Station, we do have a project in Capital Outlay to replace the Calypso Pump Station and that is in the range of 5 million dollars. We also have a new pump station and a small retention area proposed for the Georgia Street area and we have already received a lot of the funding and we have come up with a way to match that so that the city is not out of a lot of money. That was through the state flood program and then we have another major drainage project through the state flood program that's going to be the Youngs Bayou Retention Pond and that's going to help relieve not only the central parts of the City from flooding and that south around Parkview and around Wossman High School and where the new school is being built. Those are some good projects and its going to help a lot of people, we completed the Rochelle Retention Pond a couple of year ago and that has done phenomenal. Councilman Harvey noted those are great projects, but do we expect those to have any impact on repairs and maintenance in this budget cycle. Mr. Janway noted not this budget cycle. Mayor Mayo noted that is why we spend a lot of time in Baton Rouge as well as Washington DC trying to get additional funding because what we budget is a realistic budget, but it is not enough to cover all the things that we need to cover. Because of the nature of the things we do these pump stations for instance 18 pump stations and if Mr. Janway were to say what's all pulled into them all over the city logs, and all kinds of debris which causes them to malfunction because they are mechanical and having the Infrastructure Commission to assist us. I know we have had numerous conversations about what's need in different line items, but we all know it's based on the revenue that we have in terms of the budgeting process. Further discussion follows. 10.) Planning & Urban Development (PUD) (a) 2001 Community Development Block Grant All other funds under the direction of PUD Ellen Hill, Director Councilwoman Woods asked Mrs. Hill to tell them what's changed or different in your budget. Mrs. Hill noted that nothing as changed they have done some realignments with staff duties and looking at where they will be able to best be efficient with our budget considering the activities, we are planning on taking on, like the blight boot camp we are starting this spring. The idea is that will be a yearly event run through Code Enforcement. They have looked to leverage by looking at CDBG a little differently, the fund for example they need a software where they are going to have citizens be able to track where Code Enforcement cases are so from the time you call in and a case get started we will have an online platform that people can look and see whether or not it has moved to Environmental Court or come to council for anything. That is a partnership between our Code Enforcement and Community Development Division in leveraging our fund, it's not costing our general fund any extra funds. Councilwoman Ezernack asked as a result of the comprehensive planning that you have been doing and getting that ready, do we expect to be able to secure any additional funds. Mrs. Hill noted that hopefully we will have a better plan to be able to look to even HUD Funding to look at different discretionary funding and now be able to compete for those. The Census is now key to make sure that we do maintain our population, then as congress allocate more funds for CDBG or HOME that we end up with more money. So, for 2021 congress allocated more money to CDBG and HOME so we got a little bump, but this requires us to maintain our population to be an entitlement city. So, yes, the great feedback we have gotten from our comprehensive plan will allow us to really look at other funding and use that data to compete. Councilwoman Ezernack noted that at one of the meetings Mrs. Hill mentioned that it's going to be able to be used in some other areas instead of being zoned in on one specific census tract. Mrs. Hill noted that something else that they are doing differently by realigning staff and leveraging funds, Mr. Johnson mentioned that they will be hiring 2 Vista members both focusing on neighborhood revitalization plans that will allow us to be more flexible with our money once HUD approves those plans. They have started already serving citizens where they are, so right now the current year we are in and going into we service people based on the fact that they are low to moderate if they are income qualified regardless of where they are in our city. We will attempt to meet that need as much as we have funding for. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know how much was the grant for the CDBG funds? Mrs. Hill noted that the CDBG for 2020 was $696,702.00 and for 2021 they now have $708,785.00. HOME is a little different it is $316,046.00 for 2020 and for 2021 HOME allocations went down to $297,074.00. Councilman Harvey noted about the 708 and what exactly do we administer and goes out to the rehabs and things like that out of that federal grant. Mrs. Hill noted that we are limited to spending only 20% on Admin. and the rest goes into programs, when you are talking about programs for rehabs, we are projecting $265,628.00 for 2021. Councilman Harvey noted that's 708, that's 20% that mean we can spend $141,000.00 on admin. and we got $161 in wages note counting the fringe benefits, so if 20% is admin. there is more expenses parked in that fund. Mrs. Hill said that is correct because when they budget, this grant budget isn't budgeted that shows what's admin salary verses program salary, so the staff member who works on rehab is a program person not an admin person, but it is still salaried so in the city budget when we break that down it's still in the salary line item, it does not differentiate between the admin cost and the program cost. We do that on the federal side when we submit the federal budget, so what you see here for admin that is actual cost of house, but there are 2 staff people dedicated to making sure that happens and that is considered program work. You would add from the rehab cost and they would add in those salaries for staff that actually do that programmatic work as well. Mrs. Rowell added that their time is tracked through timesheets that they have to tract time that they spend on those projects. We adjust that ever so often through payroll, there percentages are divided up through the payroll program. It may be 50% on HOME, it may be 50% on CDBG and that is even broken down by project specifically if they have to. They can revisit that in the year if they need to and it may be 40/60 or whatever. Councilman Harvey wanted to know what the Capital would be in that scenario. Mrs. Hill wanted to know if he was wanting to know about equipment or what? Councilman Harvey noted that he doesn't know what this number makes up so if they are getting $700,000.00 grant, he is trying figure out what they are spending on admin, what they are actually giving to homeowners and what that looks like. Mrs. Hill noted that the equipment that they would have brought for fire depending on what it was some of it would have been capital equipment and some supplies. Councilman Harvey noted that they have had some conversation about that and if we are still buying stuff for the fire department that tells me we don't have enough people in the program to actually help out with there homes. Mr. Harvey knows that's not the case and he is really trying to understand this. Mrs. Hill noted that when they project out to spend funds, they have a certain amount of time to extend funds and they are told by the federal government here is how you can spend money. We have a cap on admin where we can only spend 20% of our money on that and what we end up spending on that is less, the only people we charge there is the Director and the Compliance Specialist. We have Rehab and for the last couple of years we have done only health and safety. We were before council last meeting with a house that ended up being far more than what we had originally thought but we have those funds, so they expended there, so we budget. What they haven't been doing is budgeting the whole grant every year, they are getting there, with the grant they use to only project what they would spend within their fiscal year and because their fiscal year doesn't line up with the federal year and they might be running behind in terms of federal allocations. They have been conservative in things that they might need to wait until the feds send the next year's money. What was done prior years if they got awarded for example in CDBG 696 and they only had 400 hundred thousand dollars' worth of projects identified then only that amount was budgeted. The other would sit in the federal allocation in the federal system where we wouldn't have project to spend those funds until we have something identified. Housing projects unfortunately have taken longer than we are used to because of the process required. We now have environmental reviews that we have to do locally for all of those houses and that makes the process a little longer if you are trying to do 6 to 8 houses a year. We are running a program now where the goal would be to budget the entire grant but also know that we are on a time crunch of being able to expend those funds and people have to qualify. We're not running a program that can budget and expend all our funds every year just because it is a program that relies on people being able to come in, qualify and move things along on a quick schedule. Councilman Harvey noted with all that where is the 106, that is what he is still missing. Mrs. Hill noted that they have determined that it is part of the fire equipment. Councilman Harvey noted that we are saying we are going to spend another 106 this year on fire equipment. Mrs. Hill noted that she would say if the estimate would be, if that's equipment that they bought will project out again and say okay we might be spending that. Every expense and as said again we have to put together a plan before we even get the funds that we have, so we have to project out and put funds somewhere, however; it doesn't get expended unless it is approved and that requires a federal approval. Councilman Harvey noted that didn't really answer the question, but he understands what she is saying for the cashflow planning stage. He just can't imagine, and he is looking, and we got $700,000.00 and a federal grant that ultimately goes to a handful of things and we got all these people that have issues with there homes and we are buying equipment for the fire department. That tells me we don't have enough people in there to give money to and there's more to that. Mr. Harvey is looking at $700,000.00 and he is trying to figure out how much of that ends up in the hands of people and their homes because that's what it seems this grant is targeted for. Mrs. Hill explained that HUD gives them money that say they can do public services, so out of this fund they are funding the WMCA for an afterschool program at a school in an eligible area. They have funds to spend on public improvements and they went through that process and the big thing that people said was they wanted funding spent on sidewalks, drainage, so if we take in account that there is a process to this an every year when we get this fund we go through an RFP process where we have a public hearing and they tell us the types of things that they would like to see, then agencies and people have to come apply and qualify. You could have 50 apply maybe out of that 10 qualify and then we go to their home and realize in order to fix their roof, we can't just do that because they need flooring, plumbing etc. and that rehab job is beyond what is outlined as basic safety stuff that they were going to do. It really goes project by project evaluating HUD also give a certain amount of time to spend these funds, so it could also go into use it or lose it. We look for way that we can serve our community and impact them, securing fire equipment helps our low-income areas. Buying life saving equipment that can go out on those fire trucks in area where that equipment did not exist. We calculate that returning investment as a big bang and we have the funds. Another investment is restrooms in public parks that people use every weekend and they are redoing that using CDBG funds as well. It is not as neatly outlined in the budget and all the funds they have has to meet HUD eligibility and they can't use the fund on anything other than things that qualify. Councilwoman Woods noted that sometimes they do use these funds for demolition. Mrs. Hill noted that is something they proposed, but in working with legal that is something we are waiting on an AG opinion. We can demolish public building and building we own it is a question about whether or not we can pay our public funds to demolish something privately owned that's not going to lead to an improvement. If someone is going to tare down their house and rebuild that we can clearly say is an improvement and we could do that. Councilwoman Woods noted that is it safe to say at the end of the day with these funds it's spent on rehabbing or doing some other things in the community. We don't turn any money back in, do we? Mrs. Hill said no. Further discussion followed. (11) Engineering (a) 2021 Capital Infrastructure All other funds under the direction of the Engineering Dept. Kim Golden, Engineer Councilwoman Woods asked if Ms. Golden would give us an overall difference of anything that's going on with her budget from last year to this year, increases etc. Ms. Golden noted that first of all it is a flat budget and they are not giving any raises to any one in any of the divisions, we are not adding any additional positions. She does have several funded vacancies, but they have carried them vacant for one thing they are in temporary quarters and if we hired anybody, they would have to sit on somebody's lap. But what she want to talk about is the philosophy of working smarter and in Traffic they have had an ongoing program of upgrading their traffic signal controllers and if you look at the trend of their overtime you will see by investing in those upgrades we are having fewer callouts. That has help offset cuts that have to be done to keep everything inline. In the Civil Division they are leveraging the asset of their GIS and that was developed as a hosted endeavor because we didn't have inhouse expertise, it was a 6-year program and it worked. At the end of the 6 years we had staff that had the competence to let us bring that inhouse. This opens up all the possibilities for instance the program Mrs. Hill referred to that Code Enforcement is using so that people can keep track that's nested with the GIS. It is going to be one of those things that really develops for the City, it is going to be a backbone of a real asset management program. It is going to take time and the departments are coming together and working around it. In Project Management and the Capital Infrastructure Fund, there are 2 divisions coming out of the general fund and that's Traffic and Civil. Project Management is totally funded by Capital Infrastructure and we have grown the number of projects that they are handling by a little reorganization internally and that we have an administrative side and guys in the field making sure it's getting built right. The administrative side not just help make sure we are keeping up with the paperwork so that we pass the audits, but we are able to handle 12 different grant programs, so we are making sure that we are in compliance. We are applying for the grant, getting the grants, getting it right and getting our money back, so to give you an idea of what's going on with these things because it is strictly under the Mayor's leadership with you all support that these things are happening. At the meeting 2 weeks ago CIC review about 18 drainage projects the total cost is a little over $42 million of that about $11.4 million is CIC dedicated funds so the only way we are able to pull down that 42 million from other sources is because we have those dedicated funds and that's about 18 projects. We have about 14 different street projects total cost is a little over $21 million with an investment of $8.4 million from CIC, so that you understand what we are able to do through project management because of that dedicated tax and the Mayor leadership and you all support. From a staffing standpoint in Traffic there are 10 funded full-time positions and 8 are filled with 2 vacancies, in Civil there are 7 funded positions 5 are filled and 2 are vacant, one is the city surveyor position. It is posted and they would love to find one but just not out there. In Project Management there are 13 full-time funded, 5 part-time funded and are operating with 6 full-time and 2 part-time. We have a pretty lean staff and we are handling a lot of work and getting ready for more. We are looking forward to moving to the one stop and having more space. Councilwoman Ezernack just wanted to thank Ms. Golden and she continue to be amazed at what her group produces project wise and the information she pushes out, so we all understand what's going on. Its very much appreciated, you have a very good group behind you who are very knowledgeable and will to assist, thank you. Mr. Golden thanked Mrs. Ezernack for recognizing them and noted that they are a good group and they work very hard. Councilwoman Woods wanted to thank Ms. Golden as well. Councilman Wilson wanted to know who are the executives? Ms. Golden explained that these are positions that are funded 100% Executive Assistant and Project Expeditor is the Project Manager, Administer, GIS Technician 1 which is a technician dedicated to water, GIS Manager is partially funded there, Project Admin. Specialist, Chief Inspector, GIS Support is a part-time position, a Right of Way and Legal Specialist is part-time that are positions funded 100% from Capital Infrs., the vacant positions that are funded in the budget has to do with 3 inspectors and she also filled receptionist and permit clerk. There is another GIS Tech position that she wants to fill but don't have space yet. Plan Reviewer and Inspector are 100% funded and the Capital Asset Management Coordinator is a new position created and when they get into new building, they will get into asset management. There are a few part-time positions having to do with some software and she keep spots funded for interns because she is looking for bright high school or college students really into math and science who would love to spend the summer doing some engineering. Councilwoman Woods thanks Ms. Golden. Mrs. Hill came back to explain what that 106 was that Councilman Harvey was inquiring about which is the 15% cap that they have on public services, it is exactly 15% of that 708 and that would be funds that go directly to agencies like meals on wheels. So that is missed labeled and it should not be capital. Councilman Harvey thanked Mrs. Hill. 12.) Administration All other funds under the direction of the Admin Dept. Stacey Rowell, Administer Mrs. Rowell Noted that Administration's budget is basically flat as well they took the .7% decrease like everyone else, so was spread out through several accounts. Councilwoman Ezernack wanted to know what's the employee count in those. Mr. Richards, Budget Officer noted that they have 2 employees in the director full-time position and they have 8 full-time in IT, 3 part-time, 11 full-time in accounting, 2 part-time, 13 full-time positions in Tax & Revenue, 3 positions in Utility Operations Trash, 1 position in Utility Operations Telecom, 7 full-time positions in personnel, 7 full-time in Purchasing and 1 part-time, 1 position in Property Control, 2 full-time in Maintenance and 1 part-time. That is 55 full-time and 7 part-time. Councilman Woods wanted to know how many hours are the part-time getting. Mrs. Rowell said that they should work less than 30 hours. Mr. Richards said they budget for 1300 hours annually. Councilman Harvey wanted to know how the user software expense jump up like that, it's about 40 grans. Mrs. Rowell noted that they have contracts and sometimes they escalate, and she has several different pieces that she pays for citywide or she could be adding software we haven't had in the past. Councilman Wilson asked if there were any raises in this budget. Mrs. Rowell said there are no raises. Councilwoman Woods asked if there were any type of restructuring. Mrs. Rowell noted that they are pretty much staying the same, they have some vacancies throughout different areas and some are being held off from filling because budget wise they have to pay out some separation pay so they are absorbing that in their budget and they can't afford to fill it until they run through all that money. Councilman Harvey asked if that was per policy or settlement. Mrs. Rowell said no, they just don't have any money. Councilman Harvey noted that when you say a separation. Mr. Richards explained that it is normal policy that when someone retire or resigns their accrual leave is pay out in lumpsum. Councilman Wilson asked what do we lease and rent? Councilman Harvey noted that is consistent across the accounts if it's copiers and printers they must have gotten a new wave. Mr. Richards, Budget Director noted that we got a bunch of computers that we are leasing as opposed to purchasing, so that is going to reflected in a lot of departments. Mrs. Rowell noted that they have to carry their share of their lease in there based on a per computer count, so that is probably what you see in their increase of lease and rental. 13.) City Expense Stacey Rowell, Administrator Mrs. Rowell noted that Dan did a good job in noting for you all with what each line is in city expense so if you have any questions or clarification for that. Councilman Harvey noted that Ouachita Council of Government that was a pretty substantial year over year increase, increase to Homeland Security. Mrs. Rowell noted that some of those we don't have a choice on, that's our share and we get told how much. The same on Homeland Security we get billed for that and that's our share. We don't know ahead of time sometimes what it is. Councilwoman Woods wanted to know who would the temporary workers be? Mrs. Rowell said that is Beverley Stewart for the Civil Service Board. Councilman Harvey noted that some of these under debt service like golf capital lease there was $75,000.00 last year and the department requested even more and are those debts rolling off. Mr. Richards noted that all that is funded out of Community Affairs Chennault Golf Budget. Councilwoman Woods asked about the workers compensation and then you have the second injury. Mrs. Rowell explained that workers comp is our actual expense for what we pay out for some claims, the second injury fund assessment that is a fee that we pay to the second injury board where they reimburse us money if someone comes to work for us and they say they have a back injury from previous, once they are hired they fill out a questionnaire and they are to list thing that are wrong with them because if they get injured on the job and it's their back then there are preexisting injuries we can apply to the second injury board and they will reimburse us toward those injuries. We have to pay so much a year into that fund to be able to do that. Councilwoman Woods noted that that fee is significant. Mrs. Rowell noted that is probably based on our workers comp claims. Councilwoman Woods asked about the prisoner housing and if that is what we are paying. Mrs. Rowell explained that is what we pay RCC to house our prisoners we were paying them 32.50. Mayor Mayo noted that it is OCC now and they are working a deal where that may decrease. Councilman Woods wanted to know what the election expenses were. Mrs. Rowell explained that we know we are having an election April 4th and the State bills us and that bill will come in next fiscal year for that election. We estimate what that is based on the past. Councilman Harvey wanted to know what we pay for coroner fees and autopsy, what cost does the city bear with that. Mrs. Rowell explained that it is for autopsy, anybody that dies inside the city limits we pay for them to go to Little Rock under certain circumstances of death. Councilman Harvey wanted to know if that was unique to the City of Monroe. Mrs. Rowell noted that it is a state mandate. We are required to support the Coroner's Office. Public hearing & final adoption of budget must occur no later than the April 14, 2020 Council Meeting. (City Charter, Article V, Sec. 5-01) There being no further business to come before the council, the meeting was adjourned at 7:57 p.m. upon motion of Mrs. Ezernack and seconded by Mr. Harvey.

Where disinfection is used in\nthe treatment of drinking water, disinfectants combine with naturally occurring\norganic and inorganic matter present in water to form chemicals\ncalled disinfection byproducts (DBPs). EPA and LDH set standards for\ncontrolling the levels of disinfectants and DBPs in drinking water, including\ntrihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acid (HAAs). Some people\nwho drink water containing THMs in excess of the MCL over many years\nmay experience problems with their liver, kidneys, or central nervous system,\nand may have an increased risk of getting cancer.\nIn December 1998, EPA set enforceable drinking water standards for\nTTHMs at 80 parts per billion (ppb) and for HAA5 at 60 parts per billion\n(ppb) to reduce the risk of cancer or other adverse health effects. Compliance\nwith the TTHMs and HAA5 standard for public water systems serving\nless than 10,000 individuals initially became effective and enforceable\non January 1, 2004. Compliance with the TTHMs standard is determined\nby calculating a locational running annual average (LRAA) of quarterly\nTTHMs sample results. Compliance calculations performed for the first\nquarter of 2020 show that the system\ufffds current TTHMs LRAAs are 93 ppb\nat DBP02 \ufffd 148 Evans Rd and 262 ppb at DBP03 \ufffd 191 Pickett Lane; thus,\nthe system is currently in violation of the TTHMs standard.\nPlease share this information with all the other people who drink this\nwater, especially those who may not have received this notice directly (for\nexample, people in apartments, nursing homes, schools, and businesses).\nYou can do this by posting this notice in a public place or distributing copies\nby hand or mail.\nThis is not an emergency. If it had been, you would have been notified\nimmediately. EPA and LDH do not consider this violation to have any\nserious adverse health effects on human health as a result of short-term\nexposure; however, continued long term exposure to TTHMs and HAA5\nlevels above the standard (e.g., 20 years of exposure) has the potential to\nhave serious adverse effects on human health.\nShould you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact the\noffice at (318) 343-6851.\n3/12\n_____________________________________________\n3/12\n________________________________________________\n3/12\n________________________________________________\n3/12\n________________________________________________\n3/12\n________________________________________________\n2/27,3/5,3/12,3/19\n________________________________________________"}, "5": {"paper": "The Ouachita Citizen", "date": "20200105", "text": "INVITATION TO BID\nProject: Culbertson Water System Improvements\nContract A \ufffd New Water Well\nLincoln Parish, Louisiana\nOwner:Culbertson Water System, Inc.\n2794 Highway 820\nChoudrant, Louisiana 71227\nEngineer: Lazenby & Associates, Inc.\n2000 North 7th Street\nWest Monroe, LA 71291\nYour firm is invited to submit a Bid to the Owner for construction of water well improvements located on Whitehead Road of Lincoln Parish.

The Chairman declared the resolution adopted on this the 17th day of February 2020. Committee Member J. Navy asked that Agenda Item No. 2 - Discussion and possible action regarding devising a coordinated plan between local and state government to re-stripe various roadways and streets in Terrebonne Parish, be placed on the agenda because he has received numerous calls regarding this issue. He explained that the lighting in some areas of the parish is \ufffddim\ufffd and fading street stripes makes it difficult to determine the sides of the roadways, especially for the elderly. Mr. Navy stated that this situation is dangerous and also hazardous for the residents of Terrebonne Parish and asked that Administration and the Council form a collaborated effort to find a viable situation to help with the re-stripping of parish streets and roadways. Public Works Director D. Rome explained that the striping of local streets and roadways has been a \ufffdlong\ufffd standing problem in the parish; stating that the parish does not have a striping crew and have to rely solely on outside contractors for this service with the exception of small scale projects.

Mr. Rome further explained that Administration has allocated additional funding for striping; stating that striping of street and roadways is a \ufffdvery\ufffd expensive project and the allocation of additional funding will help move the striping project forward. Mr. Rome stated that the parish has partnered with MPO\ufffds Local Road and Safety Program and submitted an application to receive funding for striping and other road repairs; noting that in the interim, he will be using funds from the Transportation Trust Fund and monies allocated through the annual budget to continue striping local streets and roadways. Discussion ensued with several Committee Members expressing concerns over the striping of streets and roadways, as well as, other road maintenance issues such as overlaying and the widening of roadway shoulders and the hiring of parish workers to perform striping tasks. Public Works Director D. Rome explained that the material, thermoplastic, and equipment used to stripe streets and roadways are very expensive and not cost effective for the parish to utilize at this time; stating that a majority of the contractors that the parish uses for striping is contracted out because it is a costly job. He stated that Administration\ufffds plan is to start striping local streets and roadways this summer and by next year have a parish wide striping program where the majority of the local roadways and streets will be striped.

The Chairman declared the motion adopted. Upon Council Member J. Navy\ufffds request, the Chairman recognized Mr. Christopher Pulaski, Planning and Zoning Director, who presented a rough outline for potential applications, guidelines, and procedures regarding the requesting and installation of speed humps in Terrebonne Parish. He gave a brief overview of potential application requirements and qualifying criteria for a speed hump to be considered for installation. He reported that in other communities where speed humps are used it is the applicants who are responsible for obtaining signatures confirming the support of the local residents for a potential speed hump. He then suggested that, if an application for an area is rejected, a time period of one year be observed to before accepting additional applications for that area. He then stated that the removal of a speed hump would follow the same procedures and offered suggestions for funding said speed humps with investments from property owners. Council Member J. Navy clarified that speed bumps are meant as speed control mechanisms for parking lots and should not be used for residential roadways then shared his optimism and support for the utilization of speed humps as a measure to address speeding concerns across the Parish. Council Member J. Amed\ufffde shared his concerns for traffic being diverted to other roadways once a speed hump is installed and causing greater problems then suggested that a similar time period be observed once a speed hump has been installed before it could be removed due to the costs involved in installation. He then commended Mr. Pulaski and the Planning Department for the work involved in drafting the outline and shared his opinions on similar traffic controls being utilized in Lafayette Parish. Council Member D. W. Guidry, Sr. suggested that the application process for a speed hump include a letter of no objection sent to the Council Member representing the area to notify Council Members of a speed hump request before any additional procedures took place should they object to a given installation at that time. He then stated that a traffic study was to be completed on Southdown West Boulevard then suggested that a number of four-way stops on that road could be removed and replaced with speed humps to address speeding on that roadway. Council Member J. Domangue shared some of her concerns regarding speeding traffic and shared her support for any measures to be taken to reduce speeding in Terrebonne Parish. Council Member G. Michel shared some of his experiences regarding motorists not observing posted speed limits with traffic controls in place then shared his concerns for the placement of speed humps on high-volume residential roadways. Mr. Pulaski suggested that the criterion for determining residential impacts and support be subject to staff review should a speed hump be requested at the entrance to a subdivision or other high-volume area. Council Member J. Domangue clarified that statistics had been collected regarding the effectiveness of speed humps and other traffic control measures in Lafayette Parish and other locations and that those statistics were available on the Department of Transportation and Development website. She then suggested that some of the other traffic control measures available could be more cost-effective in addressing the speeding issues in Terrebonne Parish. Council Member C. Harding shared his experiences regarding requests for traffic controls then shared his support for the continuing cooperation of the Planning and Public Works Departments in determining the best solutions available for addressing speeding issues in Terrebonne Parish. Council Member D. J. Guidry shared his concerns regarding a lack of available funding for speed humps and other control measures then shared his concern for using funding already dedicated to critical road repairs being used to install speed humps instead. Upon Council Member D. J. Guidry\ufffds request, the Chairman recognized Ms. Kandace Mauldin, Chief Financial Officer, who clarified that funding at this time would likely be pulled from the Roads and Bridges budget or from the General Fund for potential speed humps unless a grant opportunity existed that allowed for them to begin being installed in the Parish. She then suggested that a procedure should be created in order to determine a number of speed humps to be budgeted for and how they would be distributed across the parish. Council Member D. Babin shared his concerns for Roads and Bridges funding for road repair projects being used to install speed humps and other traffic controls then shared his support for investigating other revenue sources to provide for the traffic controls. Mr. J. Navy moved, seconded by Mr. D. W. Guidry, Sr. \ufffdTHAT the Council request Administration to develop the criteria, policies, and procedures necessary to allow for the installation of speed humps in Terrebonne Parish and that an ordinance establishing said criteria, policies, and procedures be drafted and presented to the Council at the next Public Services Committee Meeting for introduction and hold over.\ufffd (*MOTION VOTED ON AFTER DISCUSSION) Council Member G. Michel suggested that the motion be amended to include the costs and other data required for the funding of speed humps and other control measures before being brought to the Council for adoption. Council Member J. Navy stated that the drafted policies would include those potential costs and reiterated his resolve for taking action to address the speeding issues in the Parish. Council Member D. W. Guidry, Sr. shared his concerns for public safety with regards to speeding traffic then suggested that speed hump installations could be completed alongside road repair and overlay projects to wholly address speeding issues in the Parish. The Chairman shared his concerns for certain roadways not meeting the exact criteria as presented in the outline but would benefit from a speed hump then suggested that other parameters be considered as comparable criteria in order to also provide for those roadways. Council Member J. Navy concurred with the suggestion that Council Members be able to object to a speed hump installation in the districts they represent. Council Member D. Babin shared his concern for the need for a Council Member\ufffds approval or objection to a speed hump installation if the application process has been followed and residential support has been confirmed. Upon Council Member D. Babin\ufffds request, Council Member J. Navy reiterated his support for a Council Member\ufffds ability to object to a speed hump installation as a measure for mitigating other issues in a given district. Council Member C. Harding shared his optimism for the requested draft as a step toward addressing speeding in Terrebonne Parish. Council Member D. W. Guidry, Sr. shared his support for the inclusion of a Council Member\ufffds ability to object to a speed hump installation and suggested that budgetary constraints could require prioritizing speed hump installations to address the greatest needs of the districts. Council Member D. Babin shared his opposition for the inclusion of a Council Member\ufffds ability to object to a speed hump installation and shared his support for honoring those applications where residential support has been proven. *The Chairman called for a vote on the motion offered by Mr. J.

Mr. Navy stated that this situation is dangerous and also hazardous for the residents of Terrebonne Parish and asked that Administration and the Council form a collaborated effort to find a viable situation to help with the re-stripping of parish streets and roadways. Public Works Director D. Rome explained that the striping of local streets and roadways has been a \ufffdlong\ufffd standing problem in the parish; stating that the parish does not have a striping crew and have to rely solely on outside contractors for this service with the exception of small scale projects. He stated that the state has to approve all striping of state streets and highways and that takes time to get approved. Mr. Rome further explained that Administration has allocated additional funding for striping; stating that striping of street and roadways is a \ufffdvery\ufffd expensive project and the allocation of additional funding will help move the striping project forward. Mr. Rome stated that the parish has partnered with MPO\ufffds Local Road and Safety Program and submitted an application to receive funding for striping and other road repairs; noting that in the interim, he will be using funds from the Transportation Trust Fund and monies allocated through the annual budget to continue striping local streets and roadways. Discussion ensued with several Committee Members expressing concerns over the striping of streets and roadways, as well as, other road maintenance issues such as overlaying and the widening of roadway shoulders and the hiring of parish workers to perform striping tasks. Public Works Director D. Rome explained that the material, thermoplastic, and equipment used to stripe streets and roadways are very expensive and not cost effective for the parish to utilize at this time; stating that a majority of the contractors that the parish uses for striping is contracted out because it is a costly job. He stated that Administration\ufffds plan is to start striping local streets and roadways this summer and by next year have a parish wide striping program where the majority of the local roadways and streets will be striped.

The Chairman declared the motion adopted. Upon Council Member J. Navy\ufffds request, the Chairman recognized Mr. Christopher Pulaski, Planning and Zoning Director, who presented a rough outline for potential applications, guidelines, and procedures regarding the requesting and installation of speed humps in Terrebonne Parish. He gave a brief overview of potential application requirements and qualifying criteria for a speed hump to be considered for installation. He reported that in other communities where speed humps are used it is the applicants who are responsible for obtaining signatures confirming the support of the local residents for a potential speed hump. He then suggested that, if an application for an area is rejected, a time period of one year be observed to before accepting additional applications for that area. He then stated that the removal of a speed hump would follow the same procedures and offered suggestions for funding said speed humps with investments from property owners. Council Member J. Navy clarified that speed bumps are meant as speed control mechanisms for parking lots and should not be used for residential roadways then shared his optimism and support for the utilization of speed humps as a measure to address speeding concerns across the Parish. Council Member J. Amed\ufffde shared his concerns for traffic being diverted to other roadways once a speed hump is installed and causing greater problems then suggested that a similar time period be observed once a speed hump has been installed before it could be removed due to the costs involved in installation. He then commended Mr. Pulaski and the Planning Department for the work involved in drafting the outline and shared his opinions on similar traffic controls being utilized in Lafayette Parish. Council Member D. W. Guidry, Sr. suggested that the application process for a speed hump include a letter of no objection sent to the Council Member representing the area to notify Council Members of a speed hump request before any additional procedures took place should they object to a given installation at that time. He then stated that a traffic study was to be completed on Southdown West Boulevard then suggested that a number of four-way stops on that road could be removed and replaced with speed humps to address speeding on that roadway. Council Member J. Domangue shared some of her concerns regarding speeding traffic and shared her support for any measures to be taken to reduce speeding in Terrebonne Parish. Council Member G. Michel shared some of his experiences regarding motorists not observing posted speed limits with traffic controls in place then shared his concerns for the placement of speed humps on high-volume residential roadways. Mr. Pulaski suggested that the criterion for determining residential impacts and support be subject to staff review should a speed hump be requested at the entrance to a subdivision or other high-volume area. Council Member J. Domangue clarified that statistics had been collected regarding the effectiveness of speed humps and other traffic control measures in Lafayette Parish and other locations and that those statistics were available on the Department of Transportation and Development website. She then suggested that some of the other traffic control measures available could be more cost-effective in addressing the speeding issues in Terrebonne Parish. Council Member C. Harding shared his experiences regarding requests for traffic controls then shared his support for the continuing cooperation of the Planning and Public Works Departments in determining the best solutions available for addressing speeding issues in Terrebonne Parish. Council Member D. J. Guidry shared his concerns regarding a lack of available funding for speed humps and other control measures then shared his concern for using funding already dedicated to critical road repairs being used to install speed humps instead. Upon Council Member D. J. Guidry\ufffds request, the Chairman recognized Ms. Kandace Mauldin, Chief Financial Officer, who clarified that funding at this time would likely be pulled from the Roads and Bridges budget or from the General Fund for potential speed humps unless a grant opportunity existed that allowed for them to begin being installed in the Parish. She then suggested that a procedure should be created in order to determine a number of speed humps to be budgeted for and how they would be distributed across the parish. Council Member D. Babin shared his concerns for Roads and Bridges funding for road repair projects being used to install speed humps and other traffic controls then shared his support for investigating other revenue sources to provide for the traffic controls. Mr. J. Navy moved, seconded by Mr. D. W. Guidry, Sr. \ufffdTHAT the Council request Administration to develop the criteria, policies, and procedures necessary to allow for the installation of speed humps in Terrebonne Parish and that an ordinance establishing said criteria, policies, and procedures be drafted and presented to the Council at the next Public Services Committee Meeting for introduction and hold over.\ufffd (*MOTION VOTED ON AFTER DISCUSSION) Council Member G. Michel suggested that the motion be amended to include the costs and other data required for the funding of speed humps and other control measures before being brought to the Council for adoption. Council Member J. Navy stated that the drafted policies would include those potential costs and reiterated his resolve for taking action to address the speeding issues in the Parish. Council Member D. W. Guidry, Sr. shared his concerns for public safety with regards to speeding traffic then suggested that speed hump installations could be completed alongside road repair and overlay projects to wholly address speeding issues in the Parish. The Chairman shared his concerns for certain roadways not meeting the exact criteria as presented in the outline but would benefit from a speed hump then suggested that other parameters be considered as comparable criteria in order to also provide for those roadways. Council Member J. Navy concurred with the suggestion that Council Members be able to object to a speed hump installation in the districts they represent. Council Member D. Babin shared his concern for the need for a Council Member\ufffds approval or objection to a speed hump installation if the application process has been followed and residential support has been confirmed. Upon Council Member D. Babin\ufffds request, Council Member J. Navy reiterated his support for a Council Member\ufffds ability to object to a speed hump installation as a measure for mitigating other issues in a given district. Council Member C. Harding shared his optimism for the requested draft as a step toward addressing speeding in Terrebonne Parish. Council Member D. W. Guidry, Sr. shared his support for the inclusion of a Council Member\ufffds ability to object to a speed hump installation and suggested that budgetary constraints could require prioritizing speed hump installations to address the greatest needs of the districts. Council Member D. Babin shared his opposition for the inclusion of a Council Member\ufffds ability to object to a speed hump installation and shared his support for honoring those applications where residential support has been proven. *The Chairman called for a vote on the motion offered by Mr. J.

Mr.\nAkers explained that in 2008 - 2011 the Parish issued the\nbonds on behalf of NuStar. The Parish used its status as a\npolitical subdivision in Louisiana to issue bonds that were tax\nexempt. Tax exempt, meaning interest paid on the bonds,\nwere exempt from gross income. The bonds, since issued,\nhave been on a variable rate basis and every so often that\nrate resets, a letter of credit is also attached to provide additional\nsecurity to the bonds. Since the interest rate is low,\nNuStar has the ability to seek these rates for a longer term.\nThe ordinance amends the documents so they can go on a\nfixed rate. Councilman Cooper asked who really benefits. Mr.\nAkers indicated the benefit to the parish is that you offered\nthis opportunity to them and by NuStar being able to stabilize\nits output of revenue, that provides them additional\nopportunity to reinvest in the plant, upgrade equipment, and\ndo more for the community surrounding them. Councilman\nCooper said he wasn\ufffdt aware of some of NuStar\ufffds community\noutreach projects. Mr. Jean Zeringue answered Councilman\nCooper\ufffds questions regarding employment, saying that they\nmeet with their maintenance and construction contractors to\nhire local first.\nCouncilman Bland said using the younger generation from\nthe JumpStart Program is a step in the door for our residents.\nMr. Jimmy Brazan, President of the ARC association, said\nwhen the ARC was having financial problems NuStar gave\nlarge dollars and continues to support them. He said he\nappreciates what they have done for the ARC.\nChairman St. Pierre said we need to get a committee together\nthroughout industry to discuss current educational programs,\nhow to keep the people in the Parish.\nADJOURNMENT\nST.

No. C-6213 - Resolution to approve/reject a Board of Commerce and Industry approved application for an industrial tax exemption by ALLPAX Products, LLC. (Lorino) (Postponed 1/16/2020) Chris Masingill - CEO, St. Tammany Corporation - Allpax Products has been in St. Tammany Parish for 25 years, and they would like to stay in the Parish and expand. Their expansion will have a positive impact in taxes and local revenue. They are requesting that their application for ITEP be approved. *CLERKS NOTE: see submissions submitted into the record. Toledano - Mr. Masingill - you worked with the Council on one of the earlier ITEP applications. They had an analysis done on the effect the ITEP would have on the local fire districts and loss of revenue. Has Allpax met with the fire districts to define the impact? Masingill - through the learning process they realized they needed to do the cost analysis regarding fire departments. Allpax plans to do a partnership with the fire district. CLERK\ufffdS NOTE: see copy of e-mail from Fire Protection District No. 13 submitted for the record. Council discussion ensued. Louis Fitzmorris - Assessor - St. Tammany Parish is a unique entity - read from letter about ITEP - The Parish only has about five percent of its residential homeowners who are completely exempt, and the Parish needs more commercial properties. This Parish is the fourth largest in the State behind East Baton Rouge, Orleans, and Jefferson. All of those Parishes have the Mississippi River and all of the industry that goes along with it, including gambling. Retail businesses are not reliable for tax revenue. This project is a good investment, but the Council should review the merits of all projects requesting ITEP, as some may not be good business decisions. Council discussion ensued. Terri Lewis Stevens - the Council might want to consider modifying the giveaway of money if the Parish is on a financial cliff. Since the majority of the taxes go to the school board, why don\ufffdt we consider having the businesses at a lower amount? Davis - he called the ethics board and the economic board in Baton Rouge in regards to this matter. They\ufffdve already lowered the amount from 90% to 60% 100% to 80% (amended March 5, 2020). However, the Parish cannot wheel and deal at the local level because the ITEP program is a state mandated program. Davis - moved to adopt, second by Toledano. Unanimous with no one absent. Lorino - 2. Resolution C.S. No. C-6229 - Resolution approving the holding of an election in Recreation District No. 14 of the Parish of St. Tammany, State of Louisiana, on Saturday, May 9, 2020, to authorize the incurring of debt and issuance of bonds therein. (Cazaubon) Grant Schleuter - Foley and Judell - this is a request for an election to purchase a $7 million general obligation bond to make improvements to the Recreation District. There is no projected increase to the current millage. Cazaubon - moved to adopt, second by Dean. Unanimous with no one absent. Lorino -5. Resolution C.S. No. C-6232 - Resolution to accept ownership of portions of State Routes LA 1085, LA 434, LA 433, LA 1093-2, and LA 1129 from the State of Louisiana, Department of Transportation and Development, subject to the conditions outlined herein and to authorize the Parish President to execute documents necessary to transfer same. (Lorino/Cooper) Stefancik - he has looked at these roads, and it seems like we are piecemealing all of these roads. Some appear to be good, but he is not sure what 4/10 of a mile of Bayou Liberty Road it is listing. Jay Watson - they worked with the DOTD and are doing this as exchange for prior transfer of ownership. The roads were taken in a long time ago, and are already in our system. This Resolution is just an acknowledgment of roads which were already transferred. The only new road is Lee Road/Highway 1129. Stefancik - moved to adopt, second by Tanner.

Issuance of Additional Parity Bonds. All of the Bonds shall enjoy complete parity of lien along with the Outstanding Parity Bonds on the Net Revenues despite the fact that any of the Bonds may be delivered at an earlier date than any other of the Bonds. The City shall issue no Additional Parity Bonds having priority over or parity with the Bonds or the Outstanding Parity Bonds, provided, however, that Additional Parity Bonds may hereafter be issued on a parity with the Bonds and the Outstanding Parity Bonds under the following conditions: The Net Revenues must in each of the two (2) completed Fiscal Years immediately preceding the issuance of the additional bonds have been not less than one and threetenths (1.3) times the highest combined principal and interest requirements for any succeeding Fiscal Year period on the Bonds, the Outstanding Parity Bonds and any Additional Parity Bonds theretofore issued and then outstanding (but not including bonds which have been refunded or provision otherwise made their full and complete payment and redemption) and the bonds so proposed to be issued; and a. There must be no delinquencies in payments required to be made into the various funds maintained pursuant to Section 14 hereof; and b. The existence of the facts required by paragraph (a) and (b) above must be determined and certified to by the Director of Finance of the City; and The proceeds of the additional bonds must be used solely for the making of improvements, extensions, renewals, replacements or repairs to the Utilities System. For the purpose of this section, (i) debt service calculations shall include mandatory sinking fund redemptions or principal installments, if any, and (ii) so long as the Outstanding Parity Bonds are no longer outstanding pursuant to the terms of the Outstanding Parity Bond Ordinance, if a rate increase has been effected or a new dedicated millage or sales tax will be effective prior to the issuance of the Additional Parity Bonds or the project to be funded with the proceeds of the proposed Additional Parity Bonds will result in additional customers of the Utilities System, and a recognized engineer or firm of engineers employed by the City certifies as to the amount of additional Net Revenue that would have been realized by the City in the preceding two (2) Fiscal Years if such rate increase, new tax or additional customers had been in effect during such time, then the coverage calculations for the preceding two Fiscal Years immediately preceding the issuance of the Bonds may be made as if such additional Net Revenue had been in effect during such period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bonds, the Outstanding Parity Bonds or any Additional Parity Bonds hereafter issued may be refunded in accordance with the terms thereof and such refunding bonds or other obligations issued for such purpose shall enjoy complete equality of lien with the portion of the Bonds, Outstanding Parity Bonds or Additional Parity Bonds, as applicable, which is not refunded, if there be any, and shall continue to enjoy whatever priority of lien over subsequent issues as may have been enjoyed by the Bonds, Outstanding Parity Bonds or Additional Parity Bonds, as applicable, refunded, provided, however, that if the refunding bonds or other obligations require total principal and interest payments during any year in excess of the principal and interest which would have been required in such year to pay the Bonds, Outstanding Parity Bonds or Additional Parity Bonds, as applicable, refunded thereby, then such refunding bonds or other obligations shall not enjoy the lien priority established by this paragraph unless the City shall satisfy the foregoing conditions of this Section. SECTION 20. Schedule of Rates and Charges. Except as otherwise provided, nothing in this Bond Ordinance or in the Bonds shall be construed to prevent the City from altering, amending or repealing from time to time as may be necessary any ordinances setting up and establishing a schedule or schedules of rates and charges for the services and facilities to be rendered by the Utilities System, said alterations, amendments or repeals to be conditioned upon the continued preservation of the rights of the Owners with respect to the income and revenues of the Utilities System, not alone for the payment of the principal and interest on the Bonds, but to give assurance and to insure that the income and revenues of the Utilities System shall be sufficient at all times to meet and fulfill the other provisions stated and specified in this Bond Ordinance. It is understood and agreed, however, that the City shall fix, establish and maintain such rates and collect such fees, rents or other charges for the services and facilities of the Utilities System, irrespective of the user thereof, that no free services or facilities shall be furnished to any person, association or persons or corporation, public or private, except the City itself, and that, except for those existing unmetered accounts permitted by the Outstanding Parity Ordinance, all services shall be metered, and that no discrimination shall be made as to rates and charges for the services and facilities of the Utilities System as between users of the same type or class, provided, however, the City shall not be required to meter water used for firefighting purposes through its fire hydrants, but the City hereby agrees to pay from its general revenues a minimum annual rental of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per year for each fire hydrant connected to the Utilities System and available for firefighting. The City agrees that all charges owed by any individual, partnership or corporation for water and sewer rendered by the Utilities System shall be billed and collected as a unit; that failure of any individual, partnership or corporation to pay said combined charge within twenty (20) days of the date on which it is billed shall cause such charge to become delinquent; that if such delinquent charge, with penalties accrued thereon, is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date on which it became delinquent, the City will shut off water service to the affected premises, provided, however, that the City maintains the discretion to make reasonable decisions as to the timing of disconnections; and that the City and its officials, agents and employees will do all things necessary and will take advantage of all remedies afforded by law to collect and enforce the prompt payment of all charges made for utilities services rendered by the Utilities System. All delinquent charges for such services shall on the date of the delinquency have added thereto a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the charge. If service shall be discontinued as above provided, the customer shall in addition to paying the delinquent charges and penalties, pay as a conditions precedent to the resumption of service, a reasonable re-connection charge of not less than Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) for each service resumed. It is further understood and agreed that the schedule of rates, fees, rents and other charges being charged as of the date of the adoption of this Bond Ordinance for services and facilities rendered by the Utilities System shall remain in effect and neither said existing schedule nor any subsequent schedule shall be reduced at any time unless all payments required for all funds by this Bond ordinance, including any deficiencies for prior payments, have been fully made, and unless such schedule as so reduced will in each year thereafter produce sufficient revenues to meet and fulfill the other provisions stated and specified in this Bond Ordinance.

Such certificate shall be executed by such Owners, or by their duly authorized attorneys or representatives, and shall be filed in the office of the Council Administrator of the City. Until an event of default shall have occurred, the City shall retain full possession and control of the Utilities System with full right to manage, operate and use the same and every part thereof with the rights appertaining thereto, and to collect and receive and, subject to the provisions of this Bond Ordinance, to take, use and enjoy and distribute the earnings, income, rent, issue and profits accruing on or derivable from the Utilities System.

That it will not sell, lease or in any manner dispose of the Utilities System or any substantial part thereof, provided that the City may dispose of property which in its judgment is worn-out, unserviceable, unsuitable, or unnecessary in the operation of the Utilities System, when other property of equal value is substituted therefor, or the proceeds derived from the disposal of such property are used for constructing and acquiring extensions and improvements to the Utilities System or repairing the Utilities System. d. That except as provided in Section 19 hereof, it will not voluntarily create or cause to be created any debt, lien, pledge, mortgage, assignment, encumbrance, or any other charges having priority over or parity with the lien of the Bonds upon the income and revenues of the Utilities System pledged as security therefor. e. That to the extent permitted by law, it will not grant a franchise to any other company or organization for operation within the boundaries of the City which would render services or facilities in competition with the Utilities System, and will oppose the granting of such franchise by any other public body having jurisdiction over such matters. f. That it will not sell, lease, encumber or in any manner dispose of the Utilities System or any substantial part thereof; provided, however, that this covenant shall not be construed to prevent the disposal by the City of property which in its judgment has become worn out, unserviceable, unsuitable or unnecessary in the operation of the Utilities System, when other property of equal value is substituted therefor.

Bonds or interest installments (including the Administration Fee) for the payment of which money shall have been set aside and shall be held in trust (through deposit by the City of funds for such payment or otherwise) at the maturity or prepayment date thereof shall be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed above in this Section. Bonds shall be deemed to have been paid, prior to their maturity, within the meaning and with the effect expressed above in this Section if they have been defeased pursuant to the laws of the State of Louisiana. SECTION 28. Cancellation of Bonds. All Bonds paid or prepaid either at or before maturity, together with all Bonds purchased by the City, shall thereupon be promptly cancelled by the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent shall thereupon promptly furnish to the Council Administrator of the City an appropriate certificate of cancellation. SECTION 29. Lost, Destroyed or Improperly Cancelled Bonds. Lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Bonds may be replaced in the manner set forth in Part XI, Chapter 4, Subtitle II, Title 39 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, as amended (La. R.S. 39:971 et seq.). In case any such lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Bond has become or is about to become due and payable, the City in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Bond, pay such Bond. Upon the issuance of any replacement Bond under this Section, the City may require the payment by the Owner of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent) connected therewith. Every new Bond issued pursuant to this section in lieu of any lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Bond shall constitute a replacement of the prior obligation of the City, whether or not the lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Bond shall be at any time enforceable by anyone. The obligation of the City on any replacement bonds shall be identical as its obligation upon the original Bonds, and the rights of the registered owner shall be the same as those conferred by the original Bonds.

The designation of the initial Paying Agent in this Bond Ordinance is hereby confirmed and approved.

Every successor Paying Agent appointed hereunder shall at all times be an officer of the City or a bank or trust company organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or of any state, authorized under such laws to exercise trust powers, and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If required, the Executive Officers are hereby authorized and directed to execute an appropriate agreement with the Paying Agent for and on behalf of the City in such form as may be satisfactory to said officers, the signatures of said officers on such Agreement to be conclusive evidence of the due exercise of the authority granted hereunder. No resignation or removal of the Paying Agent shall become effective until a successor has been appointed and has accepted the duties of Paying Agent. SECTION 31. Notice to Owners. Wherever this Bond Ordinance provides for notice to Owners of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and sent via accepted means of electronic communication or mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Owner, at the address of such Owner as it appears in the Bond Register. In any case where notice to Owners is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice to any particular Owner, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to all other Bonds. Where this Bond Ordinance provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Owner entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Owners shall be filed with the Paying Agent, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. SECTION 32. Publication; Peremption. This Bond Ordinance shall be published one time in the official journal of the City, or if there is none, in a newspaper having general circulation in the City. It shall not be necessary to publish the exhibits to this Bond Ordinance but such exhibits shall be made available for public inspection at the offices of the Governing Authority at reasonable times and such fact must be stated in the publication within the official journal. For a period of thirty days after the date of such publication any persons in interest may contest the legality of this Bond Ordinance and any provisions herein made for the security and payment of the Bonds. After such thirty day period no one shall have any cause or right of action to contest the regularity, formality, legality, or effectiveness of this Bond Ordinance and the provisions hereof or of the Bonds for any cause whatsoever. If no suit, action, or proceeding is begun contesting the validity of the Bonds within the thirty days herein prescribed, the authority to issue the Bonds or to provide for the payment thereof, and the legality thereof, and all of the provisions of this Bond Ordinance and such Bonds shall be conclusively presumed, and no court shall have authority or jurisdiction to inquire into any such matter. SECTION 33. Disclosure Under SEC Rule 15c2-12. The City is not required at this time to comply with the continuing disclosure requirements described in the Rule 15c2-12(b) of the Securities and Exchange Commission [17CFR \ufffd240.15c2-12(b)]. SECTION 34. Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions of this Bond Ordinance or of the Bonds shall for any reason be held to be illegal or invalid, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect any other provision of this Bond Ordinance or of the Bonds, but this Bond Ordinance and the Bonds shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provisions had not been contained therein. Any constitutional or statutory provision enacted after the date of this Bond Ordinance which validates or makes legal any provision of this Bond Ordinance or the Bonds which would not otherwise be valid or legal shall be deemed to apply to this Bond Ordinance and to the Bonds.

The Administrative Fee shall be calculated in the same manner as interest on the Bonds. SECTION 3. Prepayment. The principal installments of the Bonds are subject to prepayment at the option of the City at any time, in whole or in part, at a prepayment price of par plus accrued interest and accrued Administrative Fee, if any, to the prepayment date and in such case the remaining principal of the Bonds shall continue to mature in installments calculated using the percentages shown in Section 2 above.

SECTION 4. Security for Payment of Bonds. The Bonds shall be secured and payable in principal and interest exclusively by a pledge of the Net Revenues. The Net Revenues are hereby irrevocably and irrepealably pledged in an amount sufficient for the payment of the Bonds and the Outstanding Parity Bonds in principal and interest as the installments thereof fall due, and the income and revenues thus pledged shall remain so pledged for the security of the Bonds and the Outstanding Parity Bonds in principal and interest until they shall have been fully paid and discharged.

SECTION 6. Sale and Delivery of Bonds. The Bonds are hereby awarded to and sold to the Department at a price of par plus accrued interest, if any, under the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement, and after their execution the Bonds shall be delivered to the Department or its agents or assigns, upon receipt by the City of the agreed first advance of the purchase price of the Bonds. Pursuant to R.S. 39:1426(B), the City has determined to sell the Bonds at a private sale without necessity of publication of a notice of sale. It is understood that the purchase price of the Bonds will be paid by the Department to the City in installments, in the manner and under the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement.

The principal and interest on the Bonds will be payable by check mailed to the Owner (determined as of the Interest Payment Date) at the address shown on the registration books kept by the Paying Agent for such purpose, provided that payment of the final installment of principal on the Bonds shall be made only upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds to the Paying Agent. SECTION 8. Execution of Bonds and Documents. The Executive Officers are each hereby empowered, authorized and directed to do any and all things necessary and incidental to carry out all of the provisions of this Bond Ordinance, to execute and deliver the Loan Agreement, and to cause the Bonds to be prepared and/or printed, to issue, execute and seal the Bonds and to effect delivery thereof as hereinafter provided.

A new Bond will be delivered by the Paying Agent to the last assignee (the new Owner) in exchange for such transferred and assigned Bond after receipt of the Bond to be transferred in proper form. SECTION 10. Effect of Registration. The City, the Paying Agent, and any agent of either of them may treat the Owner in whose name any Bond is registered as the Owner of such Bond for the purpose of receiving payment of the principal of and interest on such Bond and for all other purposes whatsoever, and to the extent permitted by law, neither the City, the Paying Agent, nor any agent of either of them shall be affected by notice to the contrary. SECTION 11. Recital of Regularity. This Governing Authority, having investigated the regularity of the proceedings had in connection with this issue of Bonds, and having determined the same to be regular, the Bonds shall contain the following recital, to wit: \ufffdIt is certified that this Bond is authorized by and is issued in conformity with the requirements of the Constitution and statutes of this State.\ufffd SECTION 12. Deposit of Bond Proceeds. The proceeds derived from the sale of the Bonds shall constitute a trust fund to be used exclusively for the purposes for which the Bonds are issued, but the purchaser of the Bonds shall not be obliged to see to the application thereof. All of the proceeds derived from the sale of the Bonds, which shall be paid in installments by the Department in the manner set forth in the Loan Agreement, shall be deposited by the City in a Construction Fund (the \ufffdConstruction Fund\ufffd).

The depositary bank for the Sinking Fund shall transfer from the Sinking Fund to the Paying Agent, at least three (3) days in advance of the date on which each payment of principal and interest falls due, funds sufficient to pay promptly the principal and interest so falling due on such date; and c.

The maintenance of the \ufffdUtilities Revenue Bond Reserve Fund\ufffd (the \ufffdReserve Fund\ufffd), previously established by Ordinance No. 3885, in which there shall be a separate account for the exclusive benefit of the Bonds (the \ufffdSeries 2020 Bonds Reserve Account\ufffd) and in which other accounts may be established at the option of the City in connection with any Additional Parity Bonds in the future (each account established within the Reserve Fund being a \ufffdReserve Account\ufffd). The money in each Reserve Account shall be retained solely for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest on the bonds secured by such Reserve Account as to which there would otherwise be default and shall be managed pursuant to the ordinance authorizing such bonds. All deposits required to be made in the Reserve Fund shall be transferred into each Reserve Account as needed on a pro rata basis; provided, however, that no transfers shall be made from the Revenue Fund into the Reserve Fund until after the payments required under paragraphs (a) through (c) above. There is hereby established the Series 2020 Bonds Reserve Account, which shall be maintained with any designated fiscal agent bank of the City and which will be used to satisfy the Series 2020 Reserve Requirement for the Bonds. The Series 2020 Bonds Reserve Account shall be funded to the Series 2020 Reserve Requirement on or before the first anniversary of the dated date of the Bonds. If at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys in a Reserve Account for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest on the bonds secured by such Reserve Account as to which there would otherwise be default, then funds shall be withdrawn from such Reserve Account and transferred to the paying agent for the bonds secured thereby. Any moneys so used shall be replaced from the revenues of the Utilities System first thereafter received and not hereinabove required for the purposes described in (a) and (b) of this Section 14, it being the intention hereof that there shall as nearly as possible be at all times on deposit in each Reserve Account an amount equal to the reserve requirement applicable to such Reserve Account. A Reserve Account may be funded with a surety bond, debt service reserve insurance policy, letter of credit, or any other credit enhancement device, and the replenishment of any draws made thereon shall be treated as a withdrawal from such Reserve Account for the purposes of this Section. All or any part of the moneys in the Utilities System Fund, Sinking Fund, and Reserve Fund, at the written request of the issuer, may be invested in Qualified Investments and such investments shall, to the extent at any time necessary, be liquidated and the proceedings thereof applied to the purposes for which such funds are created. All income or earnings from such investments shall be deposited in the Utilities System Fund as income and revenues for the Utilities System. Any moneys in remaining the Utilities System Fund after making the above required monthly payments may be used by the City for such other lawful corporate purposes as this Governing Authority may determine, without regard to whether such purposes are related to the Utilities System. In the case of issues involving term bonds, all principal maturity calculations will be based on mandatory sinking fund payment installments rather than term bond maturities. In computing the amount in any fund provided for in this Section, Qualified Investments shall be valued at the lower of the cost or the market price, exclusive of accrued interest. With respect to all funds and accounts (except the Reserve Fund), valuation shall occur annually. The Reserve Fund shall be valued semi-annually, except in the event of a withdrawal from the Reserve Fund, whereupon it shall be valued immediately after such withdrawal. SECTION 15. Replenishment of Funds. If at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys in any Reserve Account for the purpose of paying principal of or interest on bonds secured by such Reserve Account as to which there would otherwise be default, then the moneys so used shall be replaced from the Net Revenues first thereafter received, not hereinabove required to be used for the purposes described in (a) through (c) of Section 14 above. If at any time there are sufficient moneys on deposit in the Sinking Fund and the Reserve Fund to retire all outstanding bonds payable from the Sinking Fund by defeasance, by exercising the prepayment option provided by such bonds or by purchase on the open market, the City may utilize such funds for such purpose. If more than one Reserve Account is required to be replenished, then such replenishment shall be made ratably to each such account in proportion to the remaining amount that is required to be so replenished. SECTION 16. Notification of Deficiencies. As required by La. R.S. 39:1410.62 the City will notify the State Bond Commission, in writing, whenever (i) transfers to any fund required to be established by this Bond Ordinance or any resolution or ordinance authorizing the issuance of indebtedness of the City have not been made timely or (ii) principal, interest, or other payments due on the Bonds or any other outstanding indebtedness of the City have not been made timely. SECTION 17. Investments. All or any part of the moneys in the Utilities System Fund and the Sinking Fund shall at the written request of this Governing Authority be invested in Qualified Investments and all of the moneys in the Reserve Fund shall be invested in Government Securities maturing in five (5) years or less, in which event all income derived from such investments shall be added to any Revenue Account, with the exception that any interest earnings from invested funds of the Reserve Fund shall be retained therein until an amount equal to the applicable reserve fund requirement is on deposit therein, and such investments shall, to the extent at any time necessary, be liquidated and the proceeds thereof applied to the purposes for which the respective fund or account has been created. SECTION 18. Rate Covenant. The Issuer, through the Governing Authority, hereby covenants to fix, establish and maintain such rates and collect such fees, rents or other charges for the services and facilities of the Utilities System and all parts thereof, and to revise the same from time to time whenever necessary, as will always provide revenues in each Fiscal Year at least sufficient to pay (i) the necessary expenses of administering, operating and maintaining the Utilities System in such year, (ii) the principal and interest maturing on the Bonds, the Outstanding Parity Bonds and any Additional Parity Bonds in such year, (iii) all Reserve or Sinking Fund or other payments required for such year by this Bond Ordinance and the ordinances governing the Outstanding Parity Bonds and any Additional Parity Bonds, and (iv) all other obligations and indebtedness payable out of the income and revenues of the Utilities System during such year, and which will in any event provide Net Revenues at least equal to 120% of the largest amount of principal and interest maturing on the Bonds, the Outstanding Parity Bonds and any Additional Parity Bonds in any future Fiscal Year, and that such rates, fees, rents and other charges shall not at any time be reduced so as to be insufficient to provide adequate revenues for such purposes. In the event and to the extent that the revenues of the Utilities System are insufficient to satisfy the obligations payable from the funds and accounts described in Section 14 above, or the rate covenant contained in this Section, the City may take into account other lawfully available sources of funding, provided that the amount of such funding shall be actually budgeted for such purposes at the beginning of each Fiscal Year."}, "4": {"paper": "St. Tammany Farmer", "date": "20200118", "text": "PUBLIC NOTICE CITY OF COVINGTON STATE OF LOUISIANA RESOLUTION NUMBER 2020-06 A RESOLUTION OF THE COVINGTON CITY COUNCIL AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE UNCONSTRUCTED PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY ON HEBERT LANE BETWEEN EAST 10TH AVENUE AND EAST 12TH AVENUE AS A DRIVEWAY WHEREAS, the unconstructed public right of way on Hebert Lane between East 10th Avenue and East 12th Avenue is a dedicated but unconstructed public right of way; and WHEREAS, the City of Covington has received the attached request from Mildred D.

Mayor then referred to police chief Beau Killingsworth concerning the way DOTD place cones when doing evening work, stating that they seem to place them wherever they want with big vehicles able to knock them down. Chief Killingsworth responded by saying that they never really contact the Police other than for traffic control and explained that when you start using anything other than traffic control, it is all tacked on for payment in the end, but stated that he would contact them on that.

Census Bureau and the 2020 Census is upon us, explaining this census happens every 10 years and it has been done since 1790 and it is her role to make sure everyone takes the census, so she is asking the Board to pass the Resolution in saying that they support it. Ms. Wiggins mentioned that St. Tammany Parish passed the Resolution in July and have been working with every city within the parish to pass resolutions and Village of Folsom is the last one, so Folsom will be her number one city/village to promote the U.S. Census.

Ms. Wiggins concluded by stating if you receive the American Community Survey and the Centennial Census, please take them both, and informing everyone of why a Census is necessary, which is for money and power and it determines how much money a state receives and how many members in the house of representatives. Also, Ms. Wiggins mentioned that the census is hiring at $15.50 an hour and anyone receiving WIC or SNAP can work with the census and it will not hurt their benefits.

Motion to authorize clean up at 8051 Highway 28 West, Rapides Parish Highway Department Building and property, due to tornado damage, not to exceed insurance maximum. 2. Motion to discuss Alternates No. 1 and No. 2. 3.

BY ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT Laurel Smith, Secretary Rapides Parish Police Jury There were present: Craig Smith, President, Oliver \"Ollie\" Overton, Jr., Davron \"Bubba\" Moreau, Joe Bishop, Theodore Fountaine, Jr., Rusty Wilder, Sean McGlothlin and David Johnson. Absent was Police Juror: Scott Perry Also present were: Mr. Bruce Kelly, Treasurer; Ms. Donna Andries, Sales & Use Tax Administrator; Mr. Cory Ashmore, Interim Highway Superintendent; Mr. Greg Jones, Legal Counsel; and Ms. Laurel Smith, Secretary. The invocation was given by Mr. Theodore Fountaine. The Pledge of Allegiance was led by Mr. Sean McGlothlin. The Police Jury of the Parish of Rapides, State of Louisiana, was duly convened as the governing authority of said Parish by Hon. Craig Smith, President, who welcomed all present and then stated that the Police Jury was ready for the transaction of business. The President asked if there was any public comment on any agenda item, to which there was no response. On motion by Mr. Bubba Moreau, seconded by Mr. David Johnson, to authorize clean up at 8051 Highway 28 West, Rapides Parish Highway Department Building and property, due to tornado damage, not to exceed insurance maximum. Mr. Craig Smith, President, stated the Jury will need to hire a contractor to come in and do the cleanup. There is a maximum amount of monies to pay for cleanup. Mr. Bruce Kelly stated the insurance policy paid $250,000 for demolition. The Jury will need to go out for proposals. We hope to have the proposals ready February 26, 2020 and open them on March 16th, with an estimated date of completion April 15th. If we rebuild, there are somethings we can keep, to help save us some money. If we are not, then we will need to know which way to go to demolish the building. He stated at the last meeting, there was a motion to do the demolition but then, but I can't go out and demolish a building if I am going to keep part of it. We need to talk about the two alternates, to get guidance on what you want to do with the Highway Department barn. Mr. Smith stated that even if we don't keep the building, we still have to do some clean up, that will fall under this category, to which Mr. Kelly stated yes, but how much of that building are we going to tear down. If I am going to build back over it, there are certain structures that I can and can't keep, according to my Engineer. In the back part where the garage is, there are iron beams that are twisted, I have to get rid of, but there are some we can keep. Discussion ensued. Mr. Bishop stated Mr. Kelly went and looked at some other properties and he did too, on the Old Boyce Road. That is a piece of property that we can move in immediately and be back in business for the Police Jury. On motion by Mr. Joe Bishop, seconded by Mr. Craig Smith, authority be given to Mr. Bruce Kelly, once the bids are received for the demolition, to take whatever contract action is appropriate and give Mr. Kelly the authority to proceed within the scope of the insurance proposal. Mr. Kelly stated he would have to show the invoice to the insurance company and it has to be for that purpose, anything outside of the scope of work, the insurance company will not pay. Mr. Greg Jones stated the RFP needs to specify the scope of the work and run it by the insurance company to make sure. Mr. Moreau questioned if the $250,000 was cleaning to the bare slab, to which Mr. Kelly stated that is what we want to do. Mr. Sean McGlothlin questioned Mr. Bruce Kelly if he was going to be overseeing this project, the demolition, to which Mr. Kelly stated no, we are going to hire a contractor and have an inspector and I am going to coordinate between. Mr. Kelly stated that this is the contractor's specialty, that's what they do. We will have bid specs drawn up by next week to go out to everybody and it's very specific. Mr. McGlothlin stated he just wanted to make sure that the Treasurer is not overseeing the demolition project, to which Mr. Jones stated that the Interim Superintendent would be the out there. On vote the motion carried. On motion by Mr. David Johnson, seconded by Mr. Joe Bishop, to discuss Alternates No. 1 and No. 2. On vote the motion carried. Mr. Craig Smith stated there are two proposals. Alternate 1 and Alternate 2. Alternate 1 is basically taking the existing building that we have, the old office space will be gone. Mr. Smith further described the drawing of Alternate 1. Mr. Oliver \"Ollie\" Overton entered at this time. Mr. Kelly stated we will lose about 3,000 square feet. It will go from 13,000 to 10,000. The cost of this is $587,000. To build the barn back like it was, you would have to take money out of our pocket. The insurance company paid for replacement cost, minus the depreciation, to give you an actual cash value. Alternate No. 1 fits into the money we got from the insurance company. Discussion ensued. Mr. Cory Ashmore stated he would like to see a satellite base at Gardner if possible. This would reduce the number of people that show up at the Parish barn. The guys that live out there, come all the way to Highway 28 barn, then turn around and go back to that area to work. Discussion ensued. Mr. Rusty Wilder stated he was familiar with the barn, it is his voting precinct. The front office area is 3,000 square feet of wasted space. Mr. Kelly stated Alternate No. 2 is a set of buildings on nine acres off Interstate 49. Take the exit to go to Cracker Barrel, follow the levee around and right before you get to U Pull It Auto Parts, its nine acres with two buildings. One building is 8,700 square feet and one is 5,000 square feet. We would have to modify the parking lot for our use. It is not a perfect fit for us and we would have to invest some money. The original thought was that Building B, another entity, the Clerk of Court was looking for storage, but a legal opinion stated she could not spend her money on that. I think the price of this building was $879,500. We got $587,000. Mr. Sean McGlothlin questioned how many acres our current barn was on, to which Mr. Kelly stated 9.91 acres. The positive to this is, that we can be in there within thirty days. Sixty days top as opposed to this other one, reconstruction, which is going to be at the end of September. Mr. Bubba Moreau questioned if they could survive out at the England Air Park building for another four or five months, to which Mr. Ashmore stated, yes, that is part of the reason he moved things out to the satellite offices, to hold the heavy traffic down at the Air Park. Discussion ensued. Mr. McGlothlin questioned Mr. Ashmore how much of our equipment we actually work on and how much do we send out, to which he stated last year a lot of the equipment was going to outside shops due to we didn't have the mechanic or the tools to work on our own equipment. Mr. Ashmore further stated that a lot of the newer dump trucks are being sent out, about 40%. Mr. Bobby Slocum, Shop Manager, stated about 40% is being subbed out and as time goes on, we are going to have less because we are not going to have equipment that we can do the work on. The satellite shops would probably be the best way to go. Mr. Kelly stated the list he handed out, was on the vehicles and equipment that was damaged in the storm and a description of the repairs that needs to be done and status on it. Some of the equipment was on an Inland Marine policy and that policy paid $641,110.00, so we are in the process of repairing them or scraping them. The others are on our automobile policy and to date, we are currently working on all of these, but we got $29,469.00 from the insurance companies on those. We haven't completed all the work yet. Mr. Joe Bishop questioned if any of the Jurors had been to both locations, to which Mr. Smith stated he couldn't answer that. Some have, he didn't know who. Mr. David Johnson stated he had stopped at the Interstate property and looked at that one. He stated it looked like it was pretty low ground and you would have to pour a bunch of concrete. He questioned Mr. Ashmore if he had been out there, to which Mr. Ashmore stated yes. Mr. Kelly stated that the shaded area is where we would have to do the improvements, to which Mr. Johnson questioned what that would cost, to which Mr. Kelly stated $1,000,000. Mr. Smith stated if you look at the numbers, the proposed sale price is $800,000. If you do improvements, insulation, doors, AC, parking lot, etc., it brings it up to $1,024,000.00. We take the insurance funds out of that, which is $587,000.00 and we would have to come up with $450,000.00 out of pocket. Mr. Johnson stated and we will still have to do demolition on Highway 28, we can't leave it like that. Mr. Smith stated that the $250,000 for cleanup would still be for the storm damage on Highway 28. The other thing on Highway 28 is, behind the shop, we had a lean to building with a compactor, some paving equipment and different things under it that got blown away. We will have to do a covered canopy over it. Motion by Mr. Theodore Fountaine, seconded by Mr. Rusty Wilder, to approve Alternate No. 1, to remodel and advertise for bids pending Public Works Chairman, President, Vice President and Legal Counsel review and approval of plans not to exceed insurance maximum.

There were none so he turned the floor over to Councilman Broussard.\n\nCouncilman Broussard stated the Recreation Committee is convened tonight to address the contract for recreation with QSA. The original contract was a three-year contract which is coming to an end making it necessary for the Council to renew or not renew. At this time, we would like QSA to give us the annual report and address the Council.\n\nMr. Tommy Picard stated they are in agreement with the contract. There may be a few things they need to discuss prior to signing it. In 2016 there were 65 kids playing basketball in Abbeville. We have 185 kids from Abbeville today playing. It is a work in progress. James has taken over our basketball program. We met with Mayor Piazza and Councilwoman Broussard Thursday to discuss things they want to do. Baseball is a work in progress. We need more support from the community to get these kids out. We have tried everything. We have sent flyers to schools, done robocalls and put banners all over town. We had about 65 kids who played last year. Mr. James Broussard stated there has been a lot of growth in the girls basketball program. The boys basketball team will be very competitive again this year. We hope to get the adjustable goals at Abbeville High School so we can have games in Abbeville. We are playing at Henry now. Councilman Plaisance stated what he hears from the public is the amount of money the City is paying for this program. It is important that we get the breakdown like you are giving us tonight regarding the number of Abbeville kids that are playing. It looks like it has gotten better this year than the previous year. Mr. Picard stated that QSA is saving the City money. Some of the kids want to play for free. We are a business and cannot do that. We broke out even in basketball. We would like the Recreation Board to help us get sponsors and kids to play. Councilwoman Broussard thanked Mr. Picard and Mr. James and everyone who is affiliated with Quality Sports. Even before she became a Councilwoman, a lot of people thought allowing QSA to run the recreation program was a bad move that the City had made. Still today, some of those people feel the same way. She is not sure where she is with this. She has to listen to her constituents and the majority that she has discussed this with are not happy. Councilman Touchet stated before you got on the Council, Councilwoman Broussard, and before we had QSA we had a lot of problems there. What happened was actually a disgrace. What are your constituents saying so you can make us aware of it and try to resolve it? If there is something that is not happening, then we need to know about that. We are saving money compared to what we were doing in the past. All those years, we had to have a director and pay for all the expenses. We also had all the headaches too. Give us those problems and let us try to address them. Mr. Norman Levine stated that last year Bronk had to raise his own money and QSA is not recognizing them. Mr. Picard stated that QSA paid their insurance, we furnished the baseballs, we gave him the concessions in order to raise money for him to go to New Mexico. He ran the league and he received all the proceeds. All he had to do was pay the umpires. Mr. Picard stated that he donated, personally, $150 to bring his kids to the Saints game. I don?t do this to be recognized. He had been doing this for 46 years. We did 8 world series. That brought $2.5 million into the community. We were never brought before this Council for recognition. The only thing we got from this Council was criticism over what we did. Mr. Levine stated the renewal should be denied. Councilwoman White stated that as to the question of recognition she would like to say that both she and Councilwoman Broussard tried numerous times to get Bronk and Bridget here with the team to recognize their accomplishments but we could not get them here. We tried for numerous meetings following their victory at the World Series. It is not that we didn?t try to recognize them it is just everybody is busy and they couldn?t get the team together to come. It does sound like QSA did quite a bit to help. Mr. Picard stated that we have a meeting Monday. We found a flag football director and we will try to do flag football. We will have a golf tournament in March at the Country Club. We are talking about a golf league. We will do anything to help. Councilman Broussard stated that we have a very good Park Director, Denise Mire, here tonight. We have some very devoted Recreation Board members, Pastor Steve Delino and Felicia Williams, here tonight also. Thank you so much for being here. He would like to remind the audience that some people may think that the grass is always greener somewhere else. He was here when Mrs. Denise Mire was doing her best to run the program. We did not have enough children at that time interested to sign up for baseball. Two teams had to keep playing each other every other day because we didn?t have a league. That is why QSA was contacted to see if we could get more children involved in recreation. This contract has done that. Mrs. Denise did an outstanding job but the numbers were not there for the local system to even create a league. Mrs. Denise Mire stated that we had a league but we had so few teams per age group. Three teams played each other over and over again. With QSA, the teams go play in other leagues. We couldn?t get enough kids to play in-house. It was about the numbers. Councilman Plaisance stated that he attended most of the World Series. There is no one who has worked harder for baseball over the years than Tommy Picard. When we look at this thing, it is probably best to move forward with this program and give it more time to see how it develops further. He touched on some new ideas tonight that they will try moving forward. Councilwoman White stated that she understands Councilwoman Broussard?s concerns. She went herself and sat down with QSA about some complaints she had received from her district and to try to see what we could do as a team. The biggest complaint she heard was that there were not enough games in Abbeville city limits and not enough practices in Abbeville city limits. James touched on the reason tonight and this is what Tommy told her too. One of the reasons is securing a gym and the other reason is not having the proper goals at the gyms inside the City of Abbeville. They worked and got goals donated to the gym in Henry as well as a gym in Erath. For us to see the proper goals in the gyms in Abbeville, we need to work to get a donation of the proper goals. We are trying to resolve some of those issues. We will probably have to renew the contract going forward but work as a team with QSA and those that are volunteering in order to solve some of the problems to make people happier and see more recreation inside the City limits of Abbeville while under the direction of QSA.\n\n-01 introduced by Mr. Brady Broussard, Jr. and seconded by Ms. Roslyn White to recommend to the City Council to renew the contract with QSA at their regular meeting scheduled for February 18, 2020.

Because we are bringing this back, and hopefully going to pass it tonight, I do have the cooperation of Mayor Eschete to remove those surcharges.

Mr. Lorraine said, \ufffdTen years ago, I voted to do that. We got the money from the Road Royalty; you don\ufffdt have that money anymore. We keep tapping into the Recreation, something\ufffds going to happen after a while. I would love to have 95% of what we pay back, they wouldn\ufffdt have much left after that. I understand they are charging a service charge and all, and all this other stuff, but I mean come on man. Out of the City, I think Mr. Jones has his park, which is out of the City, we bought all the property, nothing is on it, no lights, no nothing, and you are going to give the City back all that money. Look, I supported it, this is for ten years boys, this is not for one year, this is for ten years. Things might change hopefully, but you are looking at ten years giving them 95% of what they collect, some of you guys better wake up. Not that I don\ufffdt want to help them, I helped ten years ago by giving them the Road Royalty, but it\ufffds not there no more, it\ufffds not even close. You are kind of caught between a rock and heartbeat, I guess. You don\ufffdt want to go against them charging, but what about everybody else in the parish. I guarantee you Recreation District #3, you give them 95% of what we generate, there is not going to be much left to run this parish, I promise you that. So, you are going to do it for it for ten years, why don\ufffdt you do it for one year or two years, why don\ufffdt you make an amendment, let\ufffds be fair. If things pick up then you add. I could support it for one or two years, but not for ten. I just think if the economy gets back again, you get the Royalty, fine we did it before. But what you got to understand, the funds are not there like they used to be gentlemen. Everybody wants, wants, wants, but it is going to come to an end soon, unless the economy turns around. So, if you shorten it up, I\ufffdll support it for one or two years, but I\ufffdm only one vote, so that\ufffds it\ufffd. Chairman Autin asked if there was any other discussion from the Council. Hearing none Chairman Autin called for a vote, which carried by a vote of (8) yeas, (1) nay \ufffd Mr. Lorraine, and (0) absent. RES. NO. 20-046 APPROVING A COOPERATIVE ENDEAVOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF THIBODAUX AND LAFOURCHE PARISH GOVERNMENT FOR FUNDING THE RECREATION PROGRAM IN THE CITY LIMITS. The next item (30) on the agenda was a resolution approving Lafourche Parish Government to advertise for bids for Phase 1 of the Alidore Drainage Improvement Project; and authorizing the Parish President to sign, execute and administer any and all relevant documents. A motion was offered by Mr. Perrillioux, seconded by Mr. Wendell, and carried by a vote of (9) yeas, (0) nays, and (0) absent. RES. NO. 20-047 APPROVING LAFOURCHE PARISH GOVERNMENT TO ADVERTISE FOR BIDS FOR PHASE 1 OF THE ALIDORE DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT. The next item (31) on the agenda was a resolution approving the Parish President\ufffds appointment of Reggie Bagala for the position of Director of Community Services for Lafourche Parish Government; and authorizing the Parish President to sign, execute and administer any and all relevant documents. A motion was offered by Mr. Perrillioux, seconded by Mr. Gros. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdMr. President, you have the floor\ufffd. Parish President Chaisson said, \ufffdThank you Mr. Chairman. I said this in the beginning when we nominated the rest of the Department Heads, and I\ufffdll say it again for Mr. Bagala. We have tried to assemble the greatest team we could to help move our parish forward, and Reggie is going to be a huge addition to this. He brings a humongous skill set, which most of you know having worked with him for the last four or three years as the Internal Auditor, and my experience working with him in the previous Administration before that, so I would appreciate the support\ufffd. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdAbsolutely, and we did get copies that he was cleared from dual office holding as well as ethics, so we are good to go\ufffd. See \ufffdExhibit C\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine said, \ufffdYeah I just want to say that I got the two opinions, one from the Attorney General and one from the Ethics, I wish you would have put that in the packet. And I also want to say, I can\ufffdt understand why we didn\ufffdt go to the D.A.\ufffds Office. Usually you start off at the D.A. and then you work your way up. So, we just bypassed the D.A. and they shouldn\ufffdt have done that, but that was what was done. Now as far as, I mean every time there\ufffds an opinion come up here, you have to go to the D.A., check the records, but we didn\ufffdt go to the D.A. here, why I don\ufffdt know, I have no clue\ufffd. Chairman Autin started to say, \ufffdYeah, our District Attorney\ufffd Mr. Lorraine Interjected, \ufffdWait, wait, let me finish\ufffd. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdGo ahead\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine responded, \ufffdCommunity Service includes Head Start, Community Action, Animal Shelter, Senior Citizens, and Recreation. So, this guy is a Representative, you get money from the state and the federal government for Head Start, you get money from the state and the federal government from Community Action, how can you be doing both? How can you be a Representative and then fool with all this over here, and then you want to pay him $38.46 an hour, part time? You know what all that means to all you dedicated employees in this parish? A good slap in the face, because you got some good dedicated employees here that\ufffds been here as long as me and longer, and do their work. How do you think they feel? But I\ufffdm not going to get excited, I\ufffdm just not going to vote for it, because I just don\ufffdt think it\ufffds right. I wish next time this happens, Archie, put it in the packet, don\ufffdt come give it to me right before a meeting, and I was very disappointed that y\ufffdall didn\ufffdt go to the D.A.\ufffd. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdThank you Mr. Lorraine. I will comment that on issues related to ethics as well as dual office holding, those are going to be forwarded to the Ethics Board and to the Attorney General\ufffds Office. Our District Attorney does not make opinions on either one of those issues. I have only been in office four years, but I have already had to be confronted with it\ufffd. Mr. Melvin said, \ufffdI\ufffdm sorry, you just stole my thunder. I had to call regarding another issue, and I wrote to the A.G. because when I talked to the D.A. I was referred to the A.G. and I did call Ethics in the mix and they said, A.G. So, I got my pack from the A.G., filled it out, sent it back. I\ufffdm just looking at a few things myself, but the point is, it\ufffds the A.G. Now, real quick, do you think he is incapable of doing the job\ufffd? Chairman Autin asked, \ufffdMr. Daniel\ufffd? Mr. Melvin repeated, \ufffdDo you think Mr. Bagala is incapable of doing the job, because I think he would do an exemplary job\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine replied, \ufffdI just think it\ufffds a dual office. I mean he\ufffds a State Rep, he\ufffds trying to get you money but yet he is working for the parish\ufffd. Mr. Melvin said, \ufffdRight, I appreciate what you are thinking but the A.G. had otherwise. Thank you\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine said, \ufffdBut then you did say a while ago before you went to the Attorney General, you went to the D.A. and they told you to go over there. Why didn\ufffdt we go there\ufffd? Mr. Melvin responded, \ufffdBecause they told me they have the authority, not them\ufffd. Chairman Autin stated that it is time to move on. Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdI just want to say, go on the record, I 100% wholeheartedly support this nomination. I think you are building a great team Mr. Parish President, and I will support Mr. Bagala wholeheartedly\ufffd. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdVery good\ufffd. Chairman Autin asked if there was any other discussion from the Council. Hearing none Chairman Autin called for a vote, which carried by a vote of (8) yeas, (1) nay \ufffd Mr. Lorraine, and (0) absent. RES. NO. 20-048 APPROVING THE PARISH PRESIDENT\ufffdS APPOINTMENT OF REGGIE BAGALA FOR THE POSITION OF DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR LAFOURCHE PARISH GOVERNMENT. The next item (32) on the agenda was a resolution approving a contract between Lafourche Parish Government and Angelette-Picciola, LLC for engineering services for the project titled \ufffdWest 107th Street Drainage Improvements\ufffd; and authorizing the Parish President to sign, execute and administer said contract and any and all relevant documents. A motion was offered by Mr. Lorraine, seconded by Mr. Adams. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdOkay, discussion. Mr. President\ufffd. Parish President Chaisson said, \ufffdThank you Mr. Chairman. So, at the request of Councilman Lorraine we added this item back to the agenda, because I know it was kind of shot down during the previous Administration. Myself and the Parish Administrator rode the area with Mr. Lorraine, and there are some drainage concerns with the way the structures are up against the ditch. So, I think what we are going to do with Neal is we are going to let him start the engineering services on the project. I know Mr. Lorraine has some ideas about culverting the ditch. Whether we culvert or we do an open ditch and just relocate the ditch to get it away from some of these structures. We are going to look at cost as well. It\ufffds not just going to be hopefully, you know depending on what the engineers say, we\ufffdll fund the project accordingly. But it\ufffds, I think it is somewhat of a need for the area, so we will let the engineer kind of drive that train from the beginning to see how far we go with it\ufffd. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdOkay, thank you Mr. President, any further discussion?\ufffd. Mr. Gros said, \ufffdI\ufffdve got something\ufffd. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdMr. Dillion you have any comments on this? Are you aware of the project, have you been brought into it yet\ufffd? Mr. Dillion Baronne, Director of Public Works, replied, \ufffdYes sir. Mr. Lorraine and I rode the site and looked at it and I agree with what Mr. Chaisson said\ufffd. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdVery good. Thank you, Dillion. Mr. Gros\ufffd. Mr. Gros said, \ufffdWhen it came up before it was not for engineering though, it was to put a culvert. Is that correct or was it the same way\ufffd? Chairman Autin said, \ufffdThe West 107 th Street\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine said, \ufffdLet me just say this\ufffd. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdGo ahead Mr. Lorraine\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine said, \ufffdOn 1/7/15 I turned this in to the Parish Administration. It wasn\ufffdt this Administration, it wasn\ufffdt the other Administration, and it was a wish list like y\ufffdall turn in now for next year, whatever, and it didn\ufffdt hit the budget till 2018. It\ufffds in the 2018 budget, it\ufffds in the 2019, it\ufffds in the 2020, it\ufffds Road Sales Tax 2, it\ufffds not parish wide money. I allocated $250,000 for the project. The same thing we are trying to do right here we did on West 111 th , you can go check, I got some pictures right here I\ufffdll show you. On this project I got a house that\ufffds about 20 feet, 15 feet from the ditch and they got some trailers. The guy that usually keeps this up, he is getting old and he says he\ufffds just tired of cleaning it, tired of the parish never going and cut the grass like they should. If you fix it the way it needs to be fixed it\ufffds not any different than any canal, any drainage issue in the parish, not any different, it\ufffds case by case. We did it four blocks south, we fixed it, the parish never went back and cut the grass, they cut it themselves. It is a safety issue; they got a few kids right here. Like I said, I have it all in black and white, it wasn\ufffdt voted on with the last Administration, I don\ufffdt know why, but if you look at some of the minutes of some of the quotes that was said, it wasn\ufffdt very good, but it\ufffds all right here. I brought Mr. Chaisson who has experience with DPW, I brought Mr. Dillion and Mr. Mitch, and they agree. It drains all of West 107, it cuts across Sanders\ufffd property. Sanders\ufffd property has culverts and it is varying, then it falls into this big ditch on 3235, and that\ufffds what we want to do, take care of that. So, just let the engineer look at it and we\ufffdll go from there. I mean I don\ufffdt have no cement ditches in my district.\ufffd Mr. Gros asked, \ufffdIs it difficult to like maintain? Is there a reason why it was neglected, is it hard to get to\ufffd? Mr. Lorraine replied, \ufffdIt\ufffds where it\ufffds at Mike. It\ufffds really where it\ufffds at\ufffd. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdTough location. Mr. Perrillioux\ufffd. Mr. Perrillioux asked, \ufffdIf my memory serves me correct, wasn\ufffdt this to put landscape culverts over that ditch\ufffd? Mr. Lorraine said, \ufffdNo, you can call it landscape, you can call it what you want. It\ufffds not any different than in your district that put your culverts, and then Jerry Jones put culverts on the side of the road that was caving in\ufffd. Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdNo but my question is this Mr. Daniel, I\ufffdm just trying to figure this out because I think the last Council voted it down because you wanted to put, at parish expense, landscape culverts on private property\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine replied, \ufffdNo\ufffd. Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdAnd I think that\ufffds what the exception was the last time around\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine said, \ufffdNo, no. You are 100% wrong sir\ufffd. Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdOkay, then remind me of what the project scope is\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine said, \ufffdIt\ufffds all black and white, look you want to see it\ufffd? Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdYes, I do.\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine responded, \ufffdWell go ahead\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine showed Mr. Perrillioux some pictures of the location, then they were passed around to the rest of the Council Members. Mr. Perrillioux asked, \ufffdSo this is parish property you want to culvert\ufffd? Mr. Lorraine answered, \ufffdYes, yes\ufffd. Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdSo, it\ufffds not private property\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine said, \ufffdNo, it\ufffds not private property Corey. I wouldn\ufffdt do that\ufffd. Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdI wouldn\ufffdt do it either, that\ufffds why I\ufffdm asking\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine said, \ufffdWe have all the right of ways and the parish owns the ditch\ufffd. Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdSo, you are saying it\ufffds for safety reasons to put culverts over a ditch that\ufffds behind the row of houses that\ufffds no where near the road or the sidewalk?\ufffd Mr. Lorraine replied, \ufffdIt\ufffds exactly right behind their house, 10, 15 feet from their house\ufffd. Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdIt don\ufffdt make sense\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine said, \ufffdIt might not make sense to you but it makes sense. Listen, the people of District 9 deserve to be treated like everybody else. This is not a parish wide tax; this is a district tax. I brought it up in 2015, it made the budget in \ufffd18, \ufffd19, and \ufffd20, what more can I tell you\ufffd. Mr. Perrillioux responded, \ufffdIt looks like you want to cover a ditch that\ufffds in the back row of a house, in some fields that\ufffds not even traversed\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine replied, \ufffdLook, no, no, no. Maybe if you would go see it with your own eyes then you would be able to tell. That\ufffds the best I can do. I mean I can\ufffdt, vote the way y\ufffdall want you know, but I\ufffdm asking you to support it. It\ufffds been since 2015\ufffd. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdI\ufffdll wait a couple more minutes so that everyone else can see the pictures. Go ahead Mr. Gros\ufffd. Mr. Gros asked, \ufffdSo this is pictures of the place or is this an old job\ufffd? Mr. Lorraine\ufffds response was inaudible. Mr. Gros asked, \ufffdThis culvert right here\ufffd? Mr. Lorraine responded, \ufffdThat\ufffds the job we did four blocks south, this and this right here. You see these houses\ufffd? Mr. Gros said, \ufffdUh huh\ufffd. Mr. Lorraine said, \ufffdThey would have fell right in the ditch. That is the job we did; the parish don\ufffdt ever go back there no more\ufffd. There was a brief discussion about the pictures that was inaudible. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdMr. Perrillioux go ahead while we wait\ufffd. Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdI just want to ask the Parish President, is it common practice for the parish to invest money on private property to landscape culvert ditches that are not traversed like by vehicles or pedestrians\ufffd? Parish President Chaisson replied, \ufffdNot necessarily. I know that we previously, every Administration has put culverts in ditches to save structures, and in some cases that\ufffds what this is. Again I go back to this is a contract with the engineer to actually evaluate the project, if we get down the road and Neal and Larry say \ufffdWe can\ufffdt do it, we shouldn\ufffdt do it, maybe it\ufffds better we reshape the ditch and relocate it over a little bit to get it away from the structures\ufffd, I\ufffdm not married to culverts, I\ufffdm not\ufffd. Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdBecause yeah, if he\ufffds calling safety, I mean every ditch in the world is a safety hazard. You know we can\ufffdt afford to go culvert every ditch in the world\ufffd. Parish President Chaisson started to say, \ufffdNo, and like I said\ufffd Mr. Perrillioux interjected, \ufffdor in the parish\ufffd. Parish President Chaisson continued by saying, \ufffdNo, and again we let Neal and Mr. Larry look at the project. If we get to a point where it\ufffds not feasible, cost prohibitive, it becomes a non-safety issue and becomes more of a landscaping issue, then I think we back off\ufffd. Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdThat\ufffds what it sounds like to me\ufffd. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdMr. Wendell\ufffd. Mr. Wendell asked, \ufffdSo this is for engineering, not for the actual work\ufffd. Someone replied, \ufffdThat\ufffds correct\ufffd. Mr. Wendell said, \ufffdThank you\ufffd. Chairman Autin said, \ufffdYeah, Mr. Perrillioux was correct. We shot it down before because it was all going to be culverted without being looked at. So, we shot it down just knowing that it seemed to be private work. But I would agree, and I\ufffdm thankful that the President is stating that this is simply going to be a study. So, I can tell you from my perspective, I\ufffdm on board with his word of saying that it is a study\ufffd. Chairman Autin asked if there was any other discussion from the Council.

Mr. Jones responded, \ufffdYes sir.\ufffd Mr. Perrillioux said, \ufffdOkay. Thanks\ufffd. Chairman Autin invited anyone that wanted to speak on this resolution to come up to the podium and state their name and address for the record. Mr. Sylvester Spears, 428 Dantin Street, Raceland, Louisiana, said, \ufffdI was with the Advisory Board last night when they voted on Ms. Deyarn to be Executive Director. I was here a few months ago, and I fought for Community Action to stay in the parish. St. Mary Parish wanted to take it, and I fought real hard to keep it here, and you all were very, very understanding about that. Now, to say all of that, Ms. Stacy Savoy has been interim for a number of years, I think 2 years now. I came back and got on the Advisory Board, Ms. Stacy has been doing a wonderful job, plus she has been taking care of two entities, CACFP as well as Executive Director. Now, I work for the school board, I get off a little late, I went into the meeting and it looked like there was a meeting before the meeting to me, I don\ufffdt know. I\ufffdm just saying Ms. Deyarn, I know her very, very well, she\ufffds been with Head Start a number of years, does an excellent job with Head Start but I feel as though this is a little bit beyond her. Why take somebody who\ufffds been doing an excellent job for two years plus taking care of two entities. I see you looking at me Daniel, I know you very well, we are friends, remember that now. She has been doing a wonderful job, in the assessment from the state, I mean she improved all the way to a 12%. That hasn\ufffdt been done in a long time since Denise Hughes has been here. Now, I like Deyarn, but I don\ufffdt think she\ufffds ready for this job. She\ufffds got a wonderful staff behind her, Stacy, they are ready to go; they got some fire in them again. Before with the, I\ufffdm not even going to speak on the person before, you all know her, some of you all, it wasn\ufffdt like that. But why go backward? I know its black history month but we don\ufffdt want to go back, let\ufffds go forward and in regarding our lives and some faith, we can do that. I ask that you will reconsider this please\ufffd. Chairman Autin asked if there was any discussion. Mr. Jones said, \ufffdYes, Mr. Chairman, thank you. The Advisory Board met, the Personnel Committee met before, which is legal. Nothing was done underhanded. They had very good applicants, the Board, the Personnel Committee recommended to the Board, the Board voted for Ms. Deyarn.\ufffd Further discussion ensued about the Parish President building a team to move the parish forward, the recommendation of Mr. Jones and the Advisory Board is Ms. Gasery, that Ms. Gasery has worked in Community Action before, that the Council needs to support the Board, trusting the Council\ufffds Liaison and what they bring forward, the hiring process, and that all candidates were vetted and treated the same. Council Members also thanked Ms. Stacy Savoy for what she has done in the last couple of years. Chairman Autin asked if there was any other discussion from the Council.

I apologize for calls in to places that they shouldn?t go to. They are calling into the police department who is not equipped to handle these calls and that?s due to the Town not being equipped, and we apologize for that. Let it be known that to the folks that they should call. We don?t have an animal control department at this time. However, maybe the next budget cycle this is something the council could consider. Right now, we need to be aware that in the event a call comes in and its of a vicious dog and a violation of an ordinance, then of course the City Police Department will respond. That is the job of the City Police Department to make sure the ordinances are not violated. However, after having said this, I would like there to be no calls to my phone as well. There is no need to call cause I?m not going to see about a dog at 12:00am at night. I?m not going to do it. I feel for the individuals.

We budgeted $37,000 to pay the note. I called around to get bottles for that price to go on our old air packs, to band aid them up until we can get financing. We can get 50 for $37,500. I put in bids in the paper and was going to issue them as a state of emergency. The bottle company stated they can get the bottles before mine go out of date. I went ahead and did the bids. I need a motioned and a seconded when the lowest bids do come in. We will have to write a check up front. The only option I have. These are 30-year bottles. When we get the air packs, we will not have to buy bottles. We have to spend a little bit of money on changed the valves out. I?m ordering bottles without valves; this will be cheaper. I?m? going to put my valves I have now in them. We will take them to Monroe to have them done. That is the cheapest way right now. That?s the only option.

She is staying past her resignation date to assist the Town with the completion of the Audit. The reason we are on the noncompliance list, the 2019 audit was not completed. When we came in, they were not able to get the records they needed to complete the audit, from the previous administration. We submitted our letter of engagement, to our independent auditors after getting councils authorization. I was told that the Legislative auditors didn?t get the engagement letter. I had Vivian call the audit firm and they said they did receive the engagement letter. They did warn me that this would be the worst audit in the history because they couldn?t get what they needed at all for the last 6 months of the previous administration. They said the only thing you could do Thompson, is to let the public know what the problem is and what it has been. I?m not trying to bash the previous administration; I?m just telling the truth, about what I found and what we are looking at according to the auditors. Just look for the next audit. What they requested is what has been presented cause that what you do.\nSurplus Items\nWe have a lot of surplus items that have to be disposed of. We have notified every department. We need to get a list of all surplus.\nLegal stand point ? Methods of disposal are different for land and moveable property. The moveable property is based on the value of property being exposed of. Basically, if it?s a land deal it has to be advertised and it has to be done by ordinance. If it?s movable under $5,000.00, there is a lesser procedure you have to go through.\nMayor- As we move forward with the audit, they are asking for a capital outlay list that identifies what?s in each department and office. The items that are not needed, will be identified by serial numbers and have an inventory of each item and once disposed, will be crossed off the list.\nExecutive Session\nMotioned: Flowers to go into Executive Session\nSeconded- Ginn\nMotioned carried\nMotioned: Stringer- come out of executive session no action taken\nSeconded: Flowers\nMotioned carried\nMotioned: Flowers- to go back to regular meeting\nSeconded: Stringer\nMotioned carried\nWe discussed in closed session, Renee Stringer litigation, Midwest management litigation, 705 Leon Drive litigation and DEQ Litigation with no action taken.\nMotioned: Stringer -have mayor to sign authorization for Midwest\nSeconded: Flowers\nMotion carried\n705 Leon Drive litigation ? tabled ? next agenda\nCouncil comments- Council comments were expressed\nMayor comments ?

Mr. Mustapha reported that he attended a meeting with the Corps on January 22 in Natchitoches. He reported that there are proposed changes to the annual inspection cycle which is to be determined based on the risk assessment of the levee segment.

Mr. Mustapha reported that he has begun review of the new 100-year flood profile of the Red River between Downtown Shreveport and Lock & Dam #5. Preliminary review indicates that the elevations are 2-3 feet higher than the existing base flood elevations for the river (which were established in the late 1970's) and the June 2015 flood high water marks. The crown elevations of the Red River Levee South are above the model's 100-year flood elevations and there are no concerns for overtopping the levee. However, the levee segment from Bishop Point to Caspiana has a free board of approximately 1.6 feet and may require modification. The levee segment at the Port may also require minor modification to ensure a minimum free board of 3 feet. Overall, only about 3 miles of the levee may require minor to moderate elevation modifications.

WHEREAS, Section 34-54 of the Code of Ordinances further provides that: (a) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided subsections (1) through (11) in section 34-53(d) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. (b) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. (c) Variances shall not be issued within any designated flood way if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. (d) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. (e) Variances shall only be issued upon: (1) A showing of good and sufficient cause; (2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in section 34-53(d), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. (f) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. WHEREAS, the City Council has received a request for variance from Mr. Marcus Briggs, Executive Pastor Riverpark Church, who has requested a development permit for property located at 3232 E. 70th Street, with plans to build a children's addition onto the existing building; and WHEREAS, the City Council has received a report from the owner addressing the issues listed in Section 34-53(d), and has considered said information prior to making this decision.

The EA and FONSI are also available for public review at USDA Rural Development State Office, 3727 Government Street, Alexandria, LA 71302.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed project consists of the construction and operation of a 6.03 MW Solar Farm. Alternatives considered by Rural Development and South Alexander Development III, LLC include no action.\nThe availability of the EA for public review was announced via notice in the following newspaper: Ruston Daily Leader on January 14th, 15th, and 16th of 2020. A 15-day comment period was announced in the newspaper notice. The EA was also available for public review at the USDA Rural Development office and as well as South Alexander Development III, LLC offices.\nBased on its EA , commitments made by South Alexander Development III, LLC , and public comments received , Rural Development has concluded that the project would have no significant impact (or no impacts) to water quality, wetlands, floodplains , land use , aesthetics, transportation , or human health and safety.\nThe proposed project will have no adverse effect on resources listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The Agency has also concluded that the proposed project is not likely to affect federally listed threatened and endangered species or designated critical habitat thereof. The proposed project would not disproportionately affect minority and/or low- income populations. No other potential significant impacts resulting from the proposed project have been identified. Therefore, Rural Development has determined that this FONSI fulfills its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act , as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR ?? 1500-1508), and USDA Rural Development ' s Environmental Policies and Procedures (7 CFR Part 1970) for its action related to the project. Rural Development is satisfied that the environmental impacts of the proposed project have been adequately addressed. Rural Development federal action would not result in significant impacts to the quality of the human environment, and as such it will not prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for its action related to the proposed project.\n3td: March 12, 13, 14, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT FOR BIDS\nSealed bids will be received for the State of Louisiana by the Division of Administration, Office of Facility Planning and Control, Claiborne Office Building, 1201 North Third Street, Conference Room 1-145, Post Office Box 94095, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70804-9095 until 2:00 P.M., Thursday, April 16, 2020.\nANY PERSON REQUIRING SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS SHALL NOTIFY FACILITY PLANNING AND CONTROL OF THE TYPE(S) OF ACCOMMODATION REQUIRED NOT LESS THAN SEVEN (7) DAYS BEFORE THE BID OPENING.\nFOR:Demolition, Harper Hall and the TH Harris Building\nLouisiana Tech University\nRuston, Louisiana\nPROJECT NUMBER:01-107-18-02, WBS: F.01003912\nComplete Bidding Documents for this project are available in electronic form.

MOSES, DIRECTOR\n3td March 13, 20, 27\n\n\n\n\nPublic Notice\nNotice is hereby given that the Lincoln Parish Police Jury has declared certain immovable property as surplus property and no longer needed for public purposes. Immovable property is described as ?Parcels A & B? and is being offered for sale to the highest bidder submitting sealed bids for the purchase of said property. Minimum Bid: $185,000.00 Bid Forms more particularly describing said Parcels and Conditions of Purchase may be obtained from the Office of the Lincoln Parish Police Jury, PO Box 979, Ruston, La 71273. Bids will be received in the office of the Lincoln Parish Police Jury until 10:00 AM, Monday, March 30, 2020, at which time they will be opened and publically read.\nPb dts. 3x March 13, 20 and 27, 2020\n\n\n\n\nThe Lincoln Parish Waterworks District One is currently in violation of the maximum contaminant level (MCL)for total trihalomethanes as set forth by the State [Part XII of the Louisiana State Sanitary Code (LAC 51:XJJ)] and the Federal Primary Drinking Water Regulations (40 CFR Part 141).\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) set drinking water standards and requires the disinfection of drinking water. Where disinfection is used in the treatment of drinking water, disinfectants combine with naturally occurring organic and inorganic matter present in water to form chemicals called disinfection byproducts (DBPs). EPA and LDH set standards for controlling the levels of disinfectants and DBPs in drinking water, including trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acid (HAAs). Some people who drink water containing THMs in excess of the MCL over many years may experience problems with their liver, kidneys, or central nervous system, and may have an increased risk of getting cancer.\nln December 1998, EPA set enforceable drinking water standards for TTHMs at 80 parts per billion (ppb) and for HAA5 at 60 parts per billion (ppb) to reduce the risk of cancer or other adverse health effects. Compliance with the TTHMs and HAA5 standard for public water systems serving less than 10,000 individuals initially became effective and enforceable on January 1, 2004. Compliance with the TTHMs standard is determined by calculating a locational running annual average (LRAA) of quarterly TTHMs sample results. Compliance calculations performed for the first quarter of 2020 show that the system's current TTHMs LRAA is 83 ppb at DBP03- 3618 HWY 167; Thus, the system is currently in violation of the TTHMs standard. The sample taken January 17, 2020 was 62 ppb, but the annual was 83 ppb. The sample results for the last two quarters were 78 ppb and 62 ppb.\nPlease share this information with all the other people who drink this water, especially those who may not have received this notice directly (for example, people in apartments, nursing homes, schools, and businesses).

DRAINAGE GENERAL POLICY\nRainfall runoff from storms of all return frequencies should enter and depart from property following development in substantially the same manner as under pre-development conditions. Any proposals to modify drainage characteristics must be fully justified by engineering data that shall demonstrate to the Public Works Director that hazards to life and property will not be increased by the proposed modifications.\n\nNo individual, partnership, or corporation shall deepen, widen, fill, reroute, or change the location of any existing ditch, stream, drain or drainage canal without first obtaining written permission from the Public Works Director.\n\nSEC. 28.1-193. DRAINAGE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS\n\n(a) Drainage Reports. A drainage report, prepared and certified by a civil engineer registered as a Professional Engineer in Louisiana, shall be submitted to and approved by the Public Works Director prior to construction of certain projects. The purpose of the report is to analyze the effect that a proposed development would have upon the rainfall runoff in the vicinity of the development, to provide data to insure that the development is designed to be protected from flooding, to provide data to insure that the development is designed to minimize flooding and to provide data supporting the design facilities to be constructed for the management of rainfall runoff. Each drainage report must consider rainfall runoff from storms with a return frequency up to and including a one hundred (100) year storm. The complexity of the report depends upon the nature of the development and the site on which the development will occur. A drainage report shall be submitted by an applicant requesting any of the following:\n\n(1)Approval of subdivision plat. Proposed subdivisions must develop a comprehensive drainage plan that addresses the drainage for the entire project site. Individual lot grading plans shall not alter the approved comprehensive drainage plan.;\n(2)A permit for grading;\n(3)A permit to construct right-of-way improvements;\n(4)A permit to construct any structure, with the exception of a single-family residential structure; and\n(5)Construction of any drainage structure or channel.\n\n(b) Storm Water Storage Facilities. Except as noted below, development of all land within the city must include provisions for the management of storm water runoff from the property that is to be developed. This management may consist of constructing storm water storage facilities, such as detention basins. The basins and drainage system shall be designed such that the peak post-development storm water flow does not exceed the peak pre-development storm water flow. As a minimum, this flow shall be based on a one hundred (100) year storm. The developer and/or commercial business shall provide for maintenance of the storm water storage facilities such that they continue to operate as designed.\n\nThe requirement for construction of a storm water storage facility may be waived in the following cases:\n\n(1)The runoff has been included in a storage facility at another location;\n(2)Construction of only a single-family residential structure;\n(3)Development adjacent to a flood way or a drainage channel which has been determined by the Public Works Director, using engineering analyses provided by the developer, to have been designed and constructed to handle the additional runoff flow without increasing the potential for flood damage on any other downstream property; and\n(4)Development of a parcel under one-half acre in an area where it can be demonstrated by engineering analyses that no significant increase in the potential for flood damage will be created by the development.\n\n(c) Easements. Adequate easements must be dedicated for the construction and maintenance of any new or relocated drainage channels. All drainage easements to the City of Natchitoches shall be identified and dedicated as early as possible in the development process, but in no case shall a building permit be issued until the city has received and accepted the easement. The dedication instrument shall consist of a survey plat by a licensed professional Land Surveyor, with an accompanying legal description. The survey plat shall show the proposed easement, any existing drainage easements, any flood plain areas within the tract, and any existing drainage easements intersecting the proposed easement.\n\n(d) Flood run-off. Provisions shall be made for the best available routing of run-off water to assure that buildings or other important facilities will not be endangered by the path of major emergency flood run-off which would become active if the capacity of site?s storm drainage system is exceeded.\n\nSEC. 28.1-194. DRAINAGE SPECIFICATIONS\nWhere deemed necessary by the Public Works Director, subsurface drainage pipes, concrete curbs and gutters, catch basins, and culverts or bridges will be required.\n\n(a) The design and construction of all drainage facilities shall be made under the supervision and approval of a Civil Engineer currently licensed in the State of Louisiana. Such design shall be based upon Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development rainfall recommendations.\n\n\n(b)A Civil Engineer, currently licensed in the State of Louisiana shall certify the type of culvert material and culvert size, and that the structural requirements for a HS-20-44 vehicular loading has been provided. All bridges shall be designed for a HS-20-44 vehicular loading.\n\n(c)All bridge and drainage construction shall be in accordance with the latest edition of Louisiana Standard Specifications for Roads and Bridges, as published by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, Office of Highways, Baton Rouge.

The minimum size reinforced concrete pipe which serves as a cross drain for any street shall be eighteen (18) inches in diameter. Any alternative material shall have, as the minimum, the hydraulic capacity of an eighteen (18) inch diameter reinforced concrete pipe. Coated galvanized pipe of the types listed below may be used:\n\na.Full asphalt-coated;\nb.Asphalt-coated, with paved invert;\nc.Full smooth-interior;\nd.Polymer coated.\n\n(2)Corrugated Polyethylene Culvert Pipe (Double wall) (CPECP) may be used in most applications with pre-approval of the Public Works Director and shall conform to ASHTO M294 Type S, as allowed in Section 1006 of latest edition of Louisiana Standard Specifications fir Roads and Bridges.\n\n(3)Surface and subsurface drainage systems shall be provided, as appropriate, for collection and dispersal of storm drainage and subsurface water. These systems shall provide for the safety and convenience of residents, protection of dwellings, other improvements and usable lot areas from water damage, flooding, and erosion.\n\n(4)All culvert joints underneath any street surface shall be Type 2 or Type 3 with required wrapping for joints with filter cloth. Reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) shall conform to ASTM Designation C76 and be a minimum of Class III pipe.

At the meeting on October 21st, the Council introduced Ordinance 019-2019 to authorize the acceptance of the donation of the Payne Sewer System by TESI to the Parish.\n\nA letter was received from TESI today (2/24/2020) stating their continued willingness to participate with Natchitoches Parish in the transfer of the Payne Subdivision Sewer System AND 3 other systems in Natchitoches Parish. This was not part of the deal, never has been part of the deal. I want the Parish to know this is something I will not comprise on the 3 quarters of a million dollars is part of the agreement for Payne Subdivision and I?ll go back to the table with TESI to negotiate with them, Along with the District Attorney, we are proceeding with negotiations ONLY for the Payne Subdivision System.\n\nThe State Block Grant officials have requested a timeline for the Payne Subdivision project by March 21, 2020. Given the current status of negotiations with TESI, I have requested the assistance of our State Representatives, Bernard and Juneau, to work to have this deadline extended to continue our negotiations with TESI with all due respect to TESI, they?re making a negotiation and we?re countering that negotiation. This is for Payne Subdivision and it?s not to accept other sewage systems.\n\nChairman, Salter wanted to get clarification on the others the 3 where are they at, one at Cedar Bend, and the other one is on Patrick road?\n\nParish President, responded, the ?The third one is, now you said two and you?ve made me draw a blank. Cedar Bend, Cedar Grove and Point Place, obviously I don?t know if they?re in good shape or bad shape, but that will require a significant revisit by this Council and we?ll negotiate it with good faith and try to get it back to just Payne Subdivision.?\n\nChairman, Salter, replied, ?Is that part of they?re negotiation is for us to take four or none??\nParish President, replied, ?They didn?t say 4 or none, but they did put it in the letter indicating that?s where they were heading, and I think you know where I stand on it.?\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, ?I did visit Cedar Bend, I had a call and TESI is not taking care of Cedar Bend, I think David, you talked to someone out there and they have some issues, that they?re trying to resolve themselves, so they?re negotiating some things they?re trying to take care their area before they would be faced with some of the things, problems like in Payne Subdivision as right now. Can David, say what he told the person.?\n\nMr. Kees, begins, ?I did find back when the Cedar Bend subdivision was first approved for a subdivision they put into their basically Homeowners Association a rule that you could not have an individual sewage system, when you do that the State Sanitation Department would not allow you to have an individual sewage system, so if for whatever reason that sewage system winds up not being able to handle the capacity that originally would have thought when the subdivision was approved for what I found the residents would need to ask the Health Department to revisit the capacity of that sewage system. I spoke with a lady and I can?t remember her name, right now, with the State Health Department who told me the really the only way they are going to do that is that they?re going to currently take the information that they already have and reassessed based off of that. They?re not, it won?t be site inspections and all that, that would be an option for the residents to have for the State Health Department and they can call our Health Department Health Unit here to get that process rolling.?\n\nChairman, Salter, asked, ?For individual Sewage systems?? Mr. Kees, replied, ?To get the approval to not to attach on to that sewage system, that community sewage system and to put an individual one down for any new development, as you go.? Chairman, Salter, replied, ?Basically that subdivision was always at the end to begin with and then they start coming toward the highway and there are some individual sewage systems along there but I don?t know if it was because of the square footage on the lot.? Mr. Kees, replied, ?I think it was at one end wasn?t considered part of the actual subdivided part in the subdivision, when it was approved.?\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, stated, ?I think that sewage system was designed at the time for only about 200 residents and they have superseded that.? Chairman, Salter, responded, ?200 houses or people?? Councilwoman, Hoover, replied, ?200 houses.?\n\nADA COMPLIANCE:\n\nHC Ramp (Main Courthouse):\nOn July 30, 2019, the Parish received two bids with the low bid in the amount of $120,775.00 submitted by DSW Construction, LLC, Many, LA. The contract award was approved on September 16, 2019, and the contract was executed on October 7, 2019. At that time, the Notice to Proceed was issued with an effective date of October 14, 2019. The completion time is 90 days. Following issuance of the Notice to Proceed, the contractor finalized his plans for the construction and the ordered the required materials. Work began on December 9th. A contract time extension was granted by the Parish, to the contractor during the holiday season, to accommodate the increased traffic (vehicle and foot traffic) on Church St.\n\nCouncilman, Paige, stated, ?The handicap ramp out there, I?m glad to stay, it?s not taking away from the Courthouse design presently and trying to match up to what we presently have, on the dooring is there?s a possibility that the doors eventually would be changed out because it?s very difficult for a handicap individual to come through the doors having to hold it and pull it, some automatic doors at some point would be looked at.?\n\nParish President responded, ?I actually discussed that with the architects, as long as we have an officer out there at the front it?s not an urgent need, but it?s certainly something that would make it a whole lot better, but during the redesign as we go forward with the new court rooms that would be something that I asked them to put in the design.?\n\nSOLID WASTE:\n\nSolid Waste Scale House: The project has been on hold pending the execution of the new solid waste agreement. In addition, the Office of Head Start has offered to donate the two HS classroom buildings in Mansfield to the Parish. One could be used for the scale house office and the other as additional storage for public works. The Parish is waiting on removal of the federal interest in the buildings so that they can be moved to the Public Works location. At the request of the regional office of Head Start, the Parish had a number of portable buildings (Breda, NSU, Campti and Mansfield) evaluated by a local realtor and the evaluations were forwarded to Head Start on October 15, 2019.\n\nFederal Interest was removed from the buildings, and they have been transported to the Natchitoches Parish Landfill. They have been blocked and placed in their permanent locations and estimates of cost to remodel are being compiled.\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, asked, ?Wasn?t there some asbestos in one of those buildings?? Parish President, answered, ?No, ma?am, not that I?m aware of.? Councilwoman, Hoover, replied, ?Let?s have a look at that, because from what I?m understanding that it is in that building.? Parish President, replied, ?No, ma?am.? Councilwoman, Hoover, replied, ?Let?s have a look at it and see.? Parish President, replied, ?There was indoor/outdoor carpet on the floors, there were sheet rock on the walls, and it was domestic sheet rock not homemade sheet rock and the roof panels are standard roof panels.?\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, stated, ?Let the Council investigate to see, that?s all I?m asking.? Chairman, Salter, stated, ?Was that the mold issue?? Councilwoman, Hoover, replied, ?Yes, that?s it the mold.? Parish President, replied, ?We had mold on the 2 sheets of sheet rock at the bottom and that was it. There is no mold in that building currently.? Chairman, Salter, asked, ?What about the point, there?s mold all over the part that you shove it together that was black with mold I saw it before it was put together.? Parish President, replied, ?We?ve taken the steps to mitigate the strip and the two pieces of sheet rock and that?s all it was. It?s open to the studs now and anyone is welcome to go and take a look.? Chairman, Salter, stated, ?Well, it?s opened, but the parts that was really molded is shut where you can?t see it, did yawl address that with anything?? Parish President, replied, ?We addressed it before we put it back together, Yes. Sir.? Chairman, Salter, asked, ?Is there anything more??\n\nParish President, responded, ?I like to talk about Ms. Harris and where she is with her staffing at the Council of Aging Center, I had a recent meeting out there and to say they?re packed to the rafters, just stuffed in, is an understatement, so I embarked upon trying to figure out a way that we can service the 1000 of people and a couple of hundreds additional people a month that seems to be coming into our office of Community Services and take care of our constituents. An option that came up is one that will come up later in a proposed Ordinance and that is for as we?re looking to move Trudeau street into a leasing arrangement with Head Start, I would like for us to reconsider that, there?s a lot of available parking and a lot of Ms. Harris constituents are nearby and there?s enough room in there for minimal dollars, I really do believe that we can get her in that building and we can have her with enough room, she?s in violation, right now, with a number of her Grants that requires a certain amount of privacy for the folk that she services, that she simply can?t do because there?s not enough room and so when we get to that item, I will like for us to bring that up again for discussion.?\n\nChairman, Salter stated the next item to adopt the minutes of the regular meeting of the Natchitoches Parish Council held Monday, January 27, 2020 and a Special Meeting January 30, 2020\n\nOn motion by Councilwoman Patsy Hoover, duly seconded by, Councilman James Kilcoyne that the Natchitoches Parish Council, in regular and legal session, does hereby adopt the minutes of the regular meeting of the Natchitoches Parish Council held Monday, January 27, 2020 and Special Meeting January 30, 2020.\n\nOn a roll call vote, the vote thereon was as follows:\nAyes: Councilwoman Hoover\nAyes: Councilman Paige\nAyes: Councilman Kilcoyne\nAyes: Councilman Cheatwood\nAyes:Councilman SalterMotion Passed\n\nChairman, Salter stated next agenda item:\n\nAppointments of Boards and Commissions.

Most of her constituents it was easier for them to come to her on this side of town than, where?s she located at. She can?t have the same building, because we?ve given that away. Yes, this sounds like something we need to do. I don?t think, Mr. Salter, when they say contaminated, what would that entail to find out how much that would cost the Parish to seek to see if there?s any contamination over there??\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, ?My question is addressed to Mr. Richmond, What type of building she would have there for her office?? Parish President, replied, ?She will have a metal building, that?s on a slab with Handicap restrooms and seven offices and currently she?s operating off of three offices and all the facilities is shared with Council of Aging.?\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, continues, ?So that building has already been looked at to know how much it will cost the Parish to have it done?? Parish President, replied, ?I don?t have an official estimate on it, but I walked through it to see the scope of work that need to get her in there and to get her in there safely and relatively comfortable the air conditioning will have to be replaced, not the entire system, but just the outside unit, I know this because it?s gone, somebody took it, and that?s the only way, I know that, but she would have plenty of parking, really and truly there?s no mold issue, and no contamination inside the building, it?s a drop ceiling like this and need fresh paint on the walls, and replace some floor tiles and she?s good to go. There?s a lot of office equipment, office desks, chairs that?s there currently and we?re saving the best of that, so that we?re want have to totally furnished it with new furniture.?\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, asked, Ms. Harris, ?Are you ok with, this, because you?re the one who has to go over there.? Ms. Harris, responded, ?I?m fine, my concern is where I?m at there?s no space, non not so ever, we?re working on top of each, I need more space and I was told that they couldn?t accommodate me more space.? Chairman, Salter, stated, ?That?s a good building down there Mrs. Hoover, a good slab.?\n\nCouncilman, Paige, stated, ?They said this was going to be a one stop shop for our Senior, and all that?s not Senior and that just didn?t pan out.? Ms. Harris, replied, ?The saying for our Senior?s, I serve more than Senior?s.? Chairman, Salter, stated, ?The Contamination issues, you?re going to take a post hole digger and get some samples and that?s probably not going to be a big issue.?\n\nCouncilman, Paige, stated, ?That?s why I wanted to touch on that because, they never did no drilling or nothing deep over there, no more than change oil.? Chairman, Salter, replied, ?They had a grease rack and that was in the ground, Johnny, probably wasn?t there, ok, let?s move on.?\n\nC. Council to Adopt Ordinance No. 003-2020 authorizing the transfer of title to property identified as the Campti Head Start Center to the Town of Campti, and to authorize the Parish President to execute the Bill of Sale and other documents required to affect the sale, as approved by the Office of the District Attorney.\n\nDiscussion C:\n\nNo Discussion.\n\nD.

Council to adopt Ordinance No. 005-2020 creating Natchitoches Parish Sewer District No. 2, establishing the geographical boundaries of the District, creating a Board of Commissioners to manage the District, establishing the\nauthority of the Board, including the setting of rates and fees for District services and implementing office systems to handle the billing for services and other business functions, and other associated tasks in connection with the District.\n\nDiscussion E:\n\nThis will be table under action taken. Parish President, replied, ?I?m asking when it comes to this one, that someone would table this from the recent letter from TESI, that arrived today, I don?t think we?re at a point to do this yet.?\n\nCouncilman Paige, stated, ?You?re saying tabling this until we get the Ordinance together, now just because TESI, say they want ice cream every Sunday, doesn?t mean that you have to abide by it, giving them ice cream every Sunday. Now, this money, this whole grant was for Payne Subdivision and now I?m hearing Point Place, and a few others, Cedar Grove, they have nothing to do with what is in hands, and we should have an individual that can write up the particular Resolution to be applied, without including those others, yes TESI would like for\nyou to take on the whole bunch of more sewage problems that they have under their umbrella, but this is a situation that we are trying to\nhelp the people of Payne Subdivision, all this other stuff they?re trying to put on to you, has nothing to do with the $753,600 dollars.?\n\nParish President, ?Mr. Chairman, I totally agree with everything that was just said, absolutely. The only thing I?m asking, there?s a lot of things that needs to be done in that proposed Ordinance, that we probably don?t won?t to do yet. We can go forward at our next meeting with this to establishing the District.?\n\nChairman, Salter, replied, ?The only thing we?ve done, was to approve for him to deal with this and that?s what he?s trying to do.?\n\nCouncilman, Paige, ?I don?t won?t us to come away with this understanding that we accept this, that we?re going to take all these other problems on, that?s not implied, whatsoever; so, sometimes people understanding is not where it needs to be and then other things get clouded and then it gets more confusing and we don?t won?t to go there, you understand, so the main issue is, we?ll deal with this when the Resolution comes forth. Thank you, Sir.?\n\nMs. Carolyn Roy, ?So what I?m hearing is that TESI don?t just want to sell you one, but all of them?? Parish President, responded, ?Ms. Roy, let me be very clear, what TESI has done is there first shot across, their first negotiation, they are asking us to take on more than, what was ever agreed upon and quite honestly that?s something we?re going to leave in the District Attorney?s hand to fire back the next letter, saying thanks, but no thanks.?\n\nMs. Roy, ?So you feel you?re still in negotiations with just Payne?? Parish President, replied, ?Absolutely. We?re only in negotiations for Payne Subdivision, Absolutely.?\n\nOn motion by Councilwoman Patsy Hoover, duly seconded by, Councilman Marty Cheatwood that the Natchitoches Parish Council,\nin regular

follows:\nAyes:Councilwoman Hoover\nAyes:Councilman Paige\nAyes: Councilman Kilcoyne\nAyes: Councilman Cheatwood\nAyes: Councilman SalterMotion Passed\n\nChairman, Salter stated next agenda item:\n\nResolutions: NONE\n\nChairman, Salter stated next agenda item:\n\nOther Agenda Items:\n\nCouncil to review a cost benefit analysis regarding the current agreement with IBTS to provide services for permitting, building inspections, code enforcement, and floodplain management.\n\nMr. David Kees, begins, ?Mr. Chairman, I sent this package out with my report, the first page is pretty simple, it?s a total number of permit fees we took in 2019, I forgot to label the front page 2019 permit fees, it was 2019 permit fees we took in $207,070.36 and the 2nd column is fees paid to IBTS for 2019 a little over $114,000 for 2019 and the third column is the net is leaves the Parish is $92,422.36. For the fees we pay to IBTS, we have Mr. Larry Walters, who does our flood plan administration, and we also get a person in the office at least 2 days a week, we can expand to more if we need to that does every inspections that is required for any permit and that includes electrical, mobile homes, and new construction, all of that. This is just for your information so that you as a Council can review it, I also provided comps and I tried to get as close as I could to what we had the first one is the City of Natchitoches, all it is, is their budget for their Planning and Zoning, they have 3 full time people, and the lines there you can see their 2017-2018 budget 2018-2019 budgets and how much they spends on Planning and Zoning the total for the City of Natchitoches, which is a much smaller area, than the Parish but about the same populations wise and located within our Parish, for the reason why I chose them because in 2017-2018 they spent $271,096 and as the Parish that would put us the same thing hiring the same personnel will put us about $60,000 in the hole. The second Comp is the City of Alexandria a little bigger size than the City of Natchitoches in terms of area, and a bigger population than our total Parish and similar numbers, you get to 2017 and 2018 and their final budget for Planning and Zoning and inspections came to $307, 535, now they have 5 full time employees, and if the Parish spent that much we would be a little over $100,000 in the hole. The last one is Red River Parish, Red River Parish employs IBTS, much like what we currently do, and you can see on there, I?m not sure what is the misc. Expense of $100.00 is, but they had revenue of $6,000 and they just chalk it up as revenues taken in and they don?t spend money for their Planning and Zoning permitting department. I also have Mr. Larry Walters and Mr. Dean Runnels here tonight and if you would like to ask them questions and I?ll be happy to answer any questions that you have, like I said, this is just a cost benefit for yawl to discuss and if anybody else here wants to discuss it we?re more than happy to answer questions and if yawl decide at a future meeting if you want to go in a different direction or if you want to keep it.?\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, ?I just want him to tell us about what our contracts says. If we decide to move away, can we move at any time? Mr. Walters if you would please.?\n\nMr. Larry Walters, ?The contract we signed with Natchitoches Parish for a 2 year agreement, now when we negotiated that contract we enter the negotiations that we agree to provide permit software based on our expense with a two year contract and that agreement is just getting started and we?re not even a year into it, it?s still the first year; so we consider our contract to show good faith with that 2 year agreement, that it will take us a 2 year period to recover the cost of the software we provided for the Parish and developed, it was a developed software that we put our money on. If we thought it was going to be any dispute, that this wouldn?t be a 2-year agreement, we did it in good faith and put our money into it for a 2-year term.?\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, stated, ?Was it stated that at any time we could move if we decided, is it after the 2-year term if we decided to?? Mr. Walters, stated, ?Yes, at the 2-year term there?s a 90-day period at this time the Parish could if they decided go with IBTS, it may be a fee increase or fee negotiations, permit fees, building inspections anything that?s associated with the contract for the 2 year period.?\n\nParish President, asked, ?When is the actual expiration date of that??\nMr. Walters, replied, ?No, I don?t.? Mr. Kees, stated, ?It will be June or July of 2021.? Mr. Walters, replied, ?The agreement we signed with you all was a continuing agreement if anybody didn?t want to make any changes in that 90 days it would just automatically renew for another 2-years. That was so that we didn?t have to come back every 2-years.?\n\nChairman, Salter, asked, ?Mr. Kees, how much was we paying the other gentlemen for doing this job 5 days a week here at this Courthouse??\n\nMr. Kees, replied, ?I don?t know the answer to that.? Chairman, Salter asked the Parish President, and his response, ?No, I don?t know.? Chairman, Salter, stated, ?That a lot of money leaving the Parish, I don?t know if he comes down here to buy groceries or gas, but that a pretty good bit of money leaving.? Mr. Kees, responded, ?I would say, that right now, we have Mr. Larry Walters that does the flood determination and flood plan management and Dean Runnels does all of our inspections and really, my salary is still under my Executive Assistance salary and you?re getting me free to do the permits, you really have 3 people currently working to make all of this happen 2 on IBTS end and mine. I believe personally it would be too much for 1 person to be able to get to every single thing that is required on a daily basis.?\n\nChairman, Salter, answered, ?I thought we was getting it done before. It was five days a week, we didn?t have to wait 2 days to set up an appointment to get an inspection. That just some questions, I would like to talk about, Mr. Paige.? Councilman, Paige, stated, ?That gentlemen, that did that job, it was much less than this, I want to say, just don?t want to spirt a number out, but he tried to get pay raises and that was a big disgruntle between him and the President at the time. I think we should ask for what was the total figure when he was present to what we?re dealing with now and by no means these people have been doing a decent job since we had them, but by no means we need to be joined at the hip with them forever, we need to be looking at some point of moving on and having our own people involved if it?s a possibility of having another individual here. I think Ms. Young was in that position and it was a significant savings with Mr. Greg at the time.?\n\nChairman Salter, replied, ?Mr. Paige, we?re sitting here with an Interim Director of Public Works and that should be solved tonight. We have an Interim Purchasing Agent, and Interim Planning and Zoning, how long are we?re going to go on like this? You understand what I?m saying.?\n\nChairman, Salter stated next agenda item:\n\nCouncil to consider for or against keeping the Home Rule charter and Council-President form of government. And to vote by motion to begin an Introduction Ordinance to repeal the Charter and to give the pleasure of the voters of Natchitoches Parish in regard to continuing to utilize the Home Rule Charter Council-President form of government or Repeal the Charter for this form of Government and replace it with the Police Jury form of government.\n\nOn motion by Councilwoman Patsy Hoover, duly seconded by Councilman Chris Paige that the Natchitoches Parish Council, in regular and legal session, does hereby Introduce Ordinance 5-2020 to repeal the Charter and to give the pleasure of the voters of Natchitoches Parish in regard to continuing to utilize the Home Rule Charter Council-President form of government or Repeal the Charter for this form of Government and replace it with the Police Jury form of government.\n\nOn a roll call vote, the vote thereon was as follows:\nAyes: Councilwoman Hoover\nAyes: Councilman Paige\nNays: Councilman Kilcoyne\nNays: Councilman Cheatwood\nAyes: Councilman SalterMotion Passed\n\nChairman, Salter, stated, ?I think we can move forward with this until, we?re just Introducing.?\n\nMs. Roy, stated, ?When this came up before you had to have 4 votes, is that still the case?? Chairman Salter, responded, ?This is just to Introduce it, we can get by with 3 to Introduce it and.?\n\nMs. Roy, stated, ?I?m not understanding what you?re doing.?\n\nChairman, Salter, stated, ?We?re Introducing an Ordinance tonight.?\n\nMs. Roy, asked, ?You don?t have to have 4 people vote for the Ordinance??\n\nChairman, Salter, replied, ?Not to Introduce it??\n\nCouncilman Paige, replied, ?Mr. Salter, that is what they held over the Council for the longest, we had 3 votes prior and it turned out the same situation where 2 gentlemen that did not vote and that?s why those 2 gentlemen sitting over there now and the people removed those two, but Lord behave it that was basically the verdict, of what happened, the individuals that did not support it and they had a room from their District, but they say it took 4 to pass and right now she?s correct.?\n\nChairman, Salter, replied, ?Hold on a seconded, didn?t you tell me we clear as to 3 to Introduce it and 4 to pass it??\n\nParish Attorney, replied, ?Chairman, to my understanding the Council is simply voting to Introduce and Ordinance, you?re not voting on the Ordinance to repeal, that would come at a later date.?\n\nMs. Roy, asked, ?So you only need 3 to Introduce it?? Parish Attorney, ?Just to approve the Introduction of an Ordinance you only need 3, but when the Ordinance comes for a vote it?s 4.? Chairman, Salter, replied, ?According to the Charter, that would be, the actual majority is 66 percent, which is that 4 votes. You understand?? Parish Attorney, stated, ?To repeal the Charter it requires a 2/3 vote of the Council.? Ms. Roy, ?So you?re just voting to Introduce it?? Chairman, Salter, ?Yes, ma?am, just to be introduced.? Ms. Roy, asked, when will it comes for Public Hearing?? Chairman, Salter, ?That will be 28 days or 30 days which is next month.?\n\nChairman, Salter stated next agenda item:\n\nCouncil to approve the Search Committee recommendation for the Director of Public Works.\n\nParish Attorney asked, ?Have this been added to the Agenda?? The Chairman, replied, ?Yes, we did, earlier.?\n\nParish President, stated, ?Mr. Chairman, we?re gone through 2 rounds of searches for Public Works Director, and the latest round all of them from the first round was included in on the 2nd round for qualifications and those meeting the qualifications was interviewed by a Committee of 2 Council members and myself and those two Council members is being Mr. Paige and Mr. Kilcoyne and our HR Director, Cathy Creamer was there with us, and we interviewed, we had 3 that met the qualifications one of those withdrew within the last days of his interview, so where we are is that we have an appointee that I would like to put up, and that?s Mr. Johnny Salard, who has been serving as our Interim Director, Johnny work at the Highway Department, for a number of years and I worked closely with Johnny for over the last year or so, so I?ll like to appoint Johnny or asked for appointment, and putting him to a Salary, and I know this Public Information, so we can go on and state it here of $65,000 which will leave Johnny some room to grow in that place and growth within that job.? Chairman, Salter, asked, ?Is this the recommendation of the Committee?? Councilman, Kilcoyne, answered, ?Yes, it was.? Chairman, Salter, asked, ?Mr. Paige.? Councilman, Paige, responded, ?I did make one interview, I couldn?t make Mr. Salard, but I told them I always work on the recommendation of the Parish President and that?s how I feel about it.?\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, stated, ?I thought, and I stand to be corrected, that this Council even though it was the committee that this Council would have a list of the applicants for us to look at as well, because we want to know who those person are that put in an application, that?s any boards commissions, anything. The Council, said that we wanted to know all of the applicants and I think you said you would provide that for us.? Parish President, replied, ?That?s not my recollection, we have to ask Sheryl, will she be able to speak on that from the minutes of our prior meetings.?\n\nThe Council Clerk, ?Are you talking about from the last meeting, on the agenda item you had to Board members, Council members and Mr. Paige, Mr. Kilcoyne, and Cathy and that was it. There wasn?t anything stated in there saying that you would give applications to the Council, that wasn?t in the last month.? Councilwoman, Hoover, replied, ?Not applications.? The Council Clerk, replied, ?The applicant names, that?s still the applications of the applicants.?\n\nChairman Salter, responded, ?In the Courtroom?? Councilwoman, Hoover, replied, ?Yes, in the Courtroom.? Chairman Salter, continues, ?The night I asked Mr. Paige and Mr. Kilcoyne to represent us and you heard, or you think you heard someone say that.?\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, replied, ?Yes, that we will always give the applicants names so we?re know if it was for Boards or Commissions or whatever, so we need to look back and see, because I would certainly would like to know who the applicants are, maybe from my District??\n\nParish President, replied, ?Ms. Creamer, says she has a list.? Ms. Creamer, stated, ?I have the email from Ms. Roy did a Public Records request and I have access to the e-mail that was sent to her with the list of the applicants.? Chairman, Salter, asked, ?You would like to have that Ms. Hoover?? Councilwoman, Hoover, answered, ?I would.? Chairman Salter, asked, ?Can you make that available??\n\nCouncilman, Paige, responded, ?Mr. Salter, you know afterwards, meeting with one of the interviewers, I made the comment and I let them know that, I think it was 6 people that was stated that had applied, and they said that 3 of the individuals didn?t qualify, specifically there was some requirements, do you have the requirements where the public would know, everyone would know what I?m talking about? That is the key to this when you say, when you ask for an applicant and you said you only interviewed 3 because I specifically wanted to know and I think I called Mr. Richmond, to find out, if we said, we?re going to kick the 3 out, did we particular asked for something within that request and I think it said a 5 year.? Ms. Roy stated, ?It was advertised.? Ms. Creamer, begins to read, ?A 5 year progressively responsible experience in the constructional repair and Maintenance of roads, bridges and drainage work or related field including substantial supervisory experience in improving management capabilities.? Councilman Paige, continues, ?Ok, see that?s my thing, it said you had to have 5 years of road, and that what kicked some of them out.? Councilwoman, Hoover, asked, ?So, they were kicked out from the result of not having the 5 years, I?m I correct?? Ms. Creamer, replied, ?Yes, Ma?am.? Councilwoman, Hoover, asked, ?So that left you with 3 correct?? Ms. Creamer, stated, ?It left us with 2, one of the qualified applicants withdrew his application, prior to interviews.? Councilman Paige, stated, ?With all of that said, regardless of what transpired in this, all 6 individuals that applied should be sent a letter of appreciation of them applying and let them they didn?t make the particular qualifications.?\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, states, ?I just want everyone to know that it was done fairly, so that?s why I?m asking these questions openly that everyone would know why these applicants was thrown out the 3 and you say, just left those 2.? Ms. Creamer, replied, ?Yes, Ma?am. It was 2 qualified.? Councilwoman, Hoover, asked, ?Of the two which made that one person stand out?? Parish President, asked, ?Stand out or withdraw?? Councilwoman, Hoover, asked, ?He withdrew?? Ms. Creamer, stated, we interviewed 2 people.? Councilwoman, Hoover, continues, ?Let me, John, if you would be quiet and let me ask Ms. Cathy a question then we can try to resolve this, Thank you. Go ahead Ms. Cathy.? Ms. Cathy Creamer, continued, ?I?m sorry repeat the question.? Councilwoman, Hoover, answered, ?You said it was 2.? Ms. Cathy, replied, ?Yes, Ma?am.? Councilwoman, Hoover, responded, ?Did the other one dropped out?? Ms. Creamer, replied, ?The 3rd dropped out and 2 was interviewed.? Councilwoman, Hoover, replied, ?Okay.? Ms. Creamer, asked, ?Now what?s the question?? Councilwoman, Hoover, replied, ?What made that person the number one, the person who actually got the position, that he was qualified over the 2 that you have? What made Johnny?? Ms. Creamer, replied, ?I believe Mr. Richmond would be more qualified to answer that question.? Chairman, Salter, stated, ?And you have Committee members.? Ms. Creamer, stated, ?I?m part of the Committee, I?m not the only vote the others was part of that also.? Councilwoman, asked ?Can you tell me?? she was talking to Councilman Kilcoyne.?\n\nCouncilman Kilcoyne, responded, ?In my opinion there was virtually no difference in the qualifications of the 2 applicants that we interviewed, and we decided to go with Mr. Salard, because obviously he?s already familiar with what we?re doing and the other gentleman has been working strictly in the private sector and didn?t have nearly the experience in public sector that Mr. Salard has and the thought with the transition to hit the ground running between the two, not that the other person wasn?t qualified, that?s not the issue, we had to make a decision and that?s what I based my decision on.? Councilwoman Hoover, responded, ?Okay, I?m ready to vote, that?s all, that?s what I wanted.?\n\nOn motion by Councilwoman Patsy Hoover, duly seconded by, Councilman Marty Cheatwood that the Natchitoches Parish Council,\nin regular and legal session, does hereby approve the appointment of Mr. Johnny Salard as the new Public Works Director for the Parish of Natchitoches.\n\nOn a roll call vote, the vote thereon was as follows:\nAyes:Councilwoman Hoover\nAyes: Councilman Cheatwood\nNays: Councilwoman Salter\nAyes:Councilman Paige\nAyes: Councilman Kilcoyne\nMotion Passed\n\nChairman, Salter stated next agenda item:\n\nVisitors for Non-Agenda Items. (3 minutes)\n\nMr. and Mrs. Pratt-Bermuda Road\n\nChairman, Salter, expressed his thanks to the Pratt?s and thank them for being patient with the Council.\n\nMr. Pratt begins, ?We want to speak about the condition of the road and what it?s causing the people, I only can speak on our experience with it, we had to replace struts, shock absorbers, and I will not try to count the number of tires we replaced four tires more than once. The rocks that was put down there initially, I thought at one time it was Winnfield rock ground up and then I looked at it again and it wasn?t so I don?t know what it was, and the white rock you was talking about was turned into sand or dust. The rocks ended up in the ditch in our yard and other people yards and this affects the homeowners it damages them really bad. Some black stuff was used to fill the potholes and put asphalt in by hand in the larger holes and cars came and took it out and then they put some green stuff down it was good as long as it stayed dried. The last was something black and turns darker when it gets wet, I don?t know what it is some type of black sand. They just graded it this past week, this black stuff they put down. The road patrol came through and knocked the top of it off and it rained and it?s right back with the same potholes before they graded it.? Chairman, Salter, asked, ?How far do you live down Bermuda?? Mr. Pratt, answered, ?Exactly halfway, one and half miles from 494.? Chairman, Salter, replied, ?You live by Pratt Lane?? Mr. Pratt, replied, ?Yes, Pratt Lane, we used to have 2 lots, but we only have one now.? Chairman, Salter, told a story about being down there on Bermuda road and breaking a strut in his truck. Mr. Salter also was saying that the Grader is not doing the grading correctly, they need to put the material on top and not at the bottom. Then Mr. Salter started to say, in the future there?s plans for that road, with some people that is going to try to help with fix it.\n\nMrs. Pratt, stated, ?The first quarter of a mile is paved, then it stops. If an emergency vehicle that supposed to come down, there it?s pretty rough and I was injured last year in Shreveport, a car hit me, and by just going over bumps that hurt bad enough.? Mr. Pratt, ?This last stuff they put down was black material it added another problem, when it rains, it?s slick like mud. This road has heavy traffic, the road where trucks is coming through there loaded down with crops what ever it is at that time, other roads in Natchitoches Parish doesn?t have that, all that heavy equipment like that. The tractors, that plows the fields are coming down that road will all the equipment already attached to the tractor. No one can get on the bridge if one of those vehicles are crossing. There?s a lot more people that use that road than people realize, at St. Paul Point, there?s people who lives up in there and St. Paul?s Church is a very large church its been there a long time, and all those people uses that road. Something needs to be done with it, I know the rest of the Parish has problems too, but they don?t have the same type of traffic, that this country road has.?\n\nChairman, Salter, stated, ?You need to bear in mind that Natchitoches Parish is primarily a place where you grow chicken or cows or you grow trees, it?s an agricultural area.? Chairman, Salter told Mr. Pratt, ?You need to get with Mr. Richmond, because he?s in charge of that, all we do is sit up here and really approves what he wants, that?s really what our job is, but we?re going to work with him to see if he?s going to carry out what he?s going to do about that road there.?\n\nMr. Pratt gave a brief summary on how he came to Natchitoches and that he was raised a farmer and he knows how everything works, with the agricultural aspect.\n\nCouncilwoman, Hoover, stated, ?Yawl or my constituents, so you know, and I visited over there and Mr. Johnny was elected tonight as Public Works Director and that was my question earlier, is there some type of material that we can find because all of the above that you just named does not work, so we are looking for solutions for the roads, I think everybody that?s in the Parish is saying what is the solution, because what we have is not working. I voted for Johnny and I?m looking for him to go out and find something that would actual be good for our Parish.?\n\nChairman, Salter, stated, ?I?m going to get in trouble, because I let you talk for over 3 minutes.? Councilman, Paige, replied, ?Mr. Salter, I was just going to thank you for letting them go longer than 3 minutes, there?s no way they could talk in 3 minutes.? Chairman, Salter, replied, ?I just broke the law.? Councilman Paige, stated, ?That?s alright, because we?re here to help people, we?re not helping them in getting their road done, but we?re hearing them.?\n\nParish President, responded, ?I would like to speak with privately, it can be tonight, or I can give you my cell phone number or you can call the office. As we look for solutions for roads that are cost effectively we have to find a way to fix Bermuda road, and take care the rest of the Parish too and believe me we?re working on that, we?re burning up the Highway and burning up the phones trying to seek funding, I?m going to leave it at that, because there is some people seating at the table that?s working with us trying to help us figure out a way to fix the situation that we have. We?re going to keep working and I?m not going to give up, neither will Mr. Salard and neither will this Council, there?s a lot of road experience sitting around this table and you have our promise that we?re going to work on this.?\n\nHoward Conday introduced himself and begins and acknowledging that he?s representing a client that was involved in a grader/car accident. He spoke with Ms. Cathy Creamer and she told him to be there tonight. Councilwoman, Hoover, stated, ?That?s Executive Session.? And the Parish Attorney, stated, ?No.? Councilwoman, Hoover, asked, ?So he?s doing it openly?? Parish Attorney, replied, ?He?s addressing the Council to give his position and then the Council can go into Executive Session, if they choose to.?\n\nHoward Conday, ?Basically the situation is, she was involved in an accident of course a grader, and operator of the grader backed into her vehicle. The Parish owns the grader; so, the Parish is reliable for my client?s property and physical injuries that she had derived from this. My understanding that the insurance didn?t cover it, but you-all is self-insured for that type of situation, and that why I had to speak to the Council and the Council would have to negotiate or give approval to negotiate this, that?s my understanding of it is. I do know there?s no liability issues here, my client should be made whole in some type of way. Ms. Creamer asked me to provide, and there?s two claims, one is a property claim and a bodily injury claim, the property claim, I?ve provided everything Ms. Creamer asked me to provide, information concerning the vehicle, how it will cost to repair the vehicle? And a host of other things. She has all that to give to the Council, I assume you have it? I?m just here to know how to report??\n\nChairman Salter, replied, ?Ok, do you know how much or is the bodily injury resolved?? Attorney Conday, replied, ?What happens in cases like this, the property gets resolved first, of course the bodily injury they are still seeing doctors, and they?re still in treatment right, now, it?s just minor injuries, small tissue injuries. Bodily injuries are determined down the line, but right now, property gets determined initially first.?\n\nChairman, Salter, stated, ?I guess I?m going to entertain a motion to go into Executive Session to see what our part is going to be.?\n\nOn motion by Councilwoman Patsy Hoover, duly seconded by, Councilman Marty Cheatwood that the Natchitoches Parish Council,\nin regular and legal session, does hereby approve to go into Executive Session.\n\nOn a roll call vote, the vote thereon was as follows:\nAyes:Councilwoman Hoover\nAyes: Councilman Cheatwood\nNays: Councilwoman Salter\nAyes: Councilman Paige\nAyes: Councilman KilcoyneMotion Passed\n\nAfter the discussion was done in Executive Session the following was done.\n\nOn motion by Councilman Chris Paige, duly seconded by Councilman Marty Cheatwood that the Natchitoches Parish Council, in regular and legal session, does hereby get out of Executive Session and enter back into the regular Session\n\nOn a roll call vote, the vote thereon was as follows:\nAyes:Councilman Paige\nAyes: Councilman Cheatwood\nAyes: Councilman Kilcoyne\nAyes:Councilwoman Hoover\nAyes: Councilman SalterMotion Passed\n\nCouncilman Paige, stated, ?Mr. Salter, Upon the Counsel request we?ll have legal Counsel for the Council to have further negotiations with the Plaintiff attorney and then bring back further discussion to the Council at a later date.?

S. 33:172 provides as follows, to-wit:\n\n\"No ordinance enlarging the boundaries of a municipality shall be valid unless prior to the adoption thereof a petition has been presented to the governing body of a municipality containing the written assent of (1) a majority of the registered voters and (2) a majority in number of the resident property owners, (3) as well as 25% in value of the property of the resident property owners within the area proposed to be included in the corporate limits according to the certificate of the Parish Assessor. If there are no registered voters residing in the area proposed for annexation, then the requirement for a majority of the registered voters on the petition shall not apply. The valuation of the property within the area proposed to be annexed shall be certified to by the Assessor according to the assessment of each of the owners signing the petition. Where there has been a change of ownership since the last assessment of the property, the Assessor shall certify the valuation of the present owner in accordance with the last case where the property of the present owner has not specifically been assessed the Assessor shall estimate the assessed value of the property for the current year and certify that same as the value of the property.\"\n\"At the request of any municipality contemplating the annexation of any tract of land, the Registrar of Voters shall provide a certified list of the registered voters residing in the area proposed to be annexed.\"\n\nREGISTRAR OF VOTERS CERTIFICATION\nORDINANCE NO. 004 of 2020\n\nI find that the following individuals are registered to vote within the property described on the attached Exhibit:\n\nCertified on this day of , 2020.\n_____ Registrar of Voters\n\nMayor Posey opened the floor for discussion.\n\nMr. Tom Moore, 334 Monroe Drive, is in opposition of the annexation. He had several concerns regarding the proposed annexation presented tonight. First, he doesn?t think there is a clear reason for the annexation. It is stated in the ordinance the City may control and regulate the development of the area to protect the City?s source of raw drinking water. He stated if annexing Chinquapin will protect the City?s raw drinking water, we should go ahead and annex all of North Natchitoches. In his opinion, this is a land grab and only the council knows if it is for a tax base increase or demographic purposes. He stated he does not know the real reason. He then stated he was told a decrease in homeowner premiums would offset the higher city taxes. He has owned a house since 1974 and has never received a decrease in his homeowner premium. Finally, he stated the proposed ordinance states a petition has been filed in accordance with the revised statute by those parties listed in Exhibit A. The second name on Exhibit A is Shirley Meyers Bordelon who has never been a property owner on Johnson Lane. Resident or not, she has not lived in the house on Johnson Lane since it burned over 4 years ago. He stated that he knows that because she is his mother in law. She doesn?t remember even signing this petition in the recent past. He gave another example of a resident adjacent to his property stating they are not property owners or registered voters. Some of the people on the list have sold property as much as 2 years ago. He stated with all due respect to the Assessor and Registrar of Voters for Natchitoches Parish how can we trust this petition is true and correct? He feels the only thing that can be expected from this annexation is higher taxes and more regulations.\n\nMayor Posey then stated is his opinion this stemmed from most of the people wanting a new road out there. He stated no sewer is going to be forced on anybody and everything that was brought up was put in writing to be grandfathered in rather than forcing things on the residents besides what takes place in a normal annexation.\n\nMs. Morrow stated she has had the opportunity to visit with some of the people who live in this area. Most of the people on this list have not been here and she doesn?t understand why if you want to be annexed in, why they wouldn?t come down here to face the council and let us know how they feel. She then stated it looks to her like someone is forcing this on people to come and she feels that is unfair. She feels annexations should be a fair process. For years, Payne Subdivision, which is just down the road from the city limit sign, has been battling parish government and all of the citizens should be treated fairly. This is an unfair process.\n\nMayor Posey asked Mr. Murchison to explain petition process when you have a piece of property versus if you are just a resident. Mr. Murchison stated, the City just takes the petition that is brought to them. So there may be people on the petition who don?t count for any of those three categories, but we put together the petition and list them as petitioners, it goes to the assessor and the assessor looks at the names and property owners, gets with the Registrar and get the registered voters, and they do the math.

Chapter 28.1, Stormwater Code, is hereby amended and re-enacted by adopting the following:\n\n?ARTICLE X. DRAINAGE\nSEC. 28.1-192. DRAINAGE GENERAL POLICY\nRainfall runoff from storms of all return frequencies should enter and depart from property following development in substantially the same manner as under pre-development conditions. Any proposals to modify drainage characteristics must be fully justified by engineering data that shall demonstrate to the Public Works Director that hazards to life and property will not be increased by the proposed modifications.\n\nNo individual, partnership, or corporation shall deepen, widen, fill, reroute, or change the location of any existing ditch, stream, drain or drainage canal without first obtaining written permission from the Public Works Director.\n\nSEC. 28.1-193. DRAINAGE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS\n\n(a) Drainage Reports. A drainage report, prepared and certified by a civil engineer registered as a Professional Engineer in Louisiana, shall be submitted to and approved by the Public Works Director prior to construction of certain projects. The purpose of the report is to analyze the effect that a proposed development would have upon the rainfall runoff in the vicinity of the development, to provide data to insure that the development is designed to be protected from flooding, to provide data to insure that the development is designed to minimize flooding and to provide data supporting the design facilities to be constructed for the management of rainfall runoff. Each drainage report must consider rainfall runoff from storms with a return frequency up to and including a one hundred (100) year storm. The complexity of the report depends upon the nature of the development and the site on which the development will occur. A drainage report shall be submitted by an applicant requesting any of the following:\n(1)Approval of subdivision plat. Proposed subdivisions must develop a comprehensive drainage plan that addresses the drainage for the entire project site. Individual lot grading plans shall not alter the approved comprehensive drainage plan.;\n(2)A permit for grading;\n(3)A permit to construct right-of-way improvements;\n(4)A permit to construct any structure, with the exception of a single-family residential structure; and\n(5)Construction of any drainage structure or channel.\n\n(b) Storm Water Storage Facilities. Except as noted below, development of all land within the city must include provisions for the management of storm water runoff from the property that is to be developed. This management may consist of constructing storm water storage facilities, such as detention basins. The basins and drainage system shall be designed such that the peak post-development storm water flow does not exceed the peak pre-development storm water flow. As a minimum, this flow shall be based on a one hundred (100) year storm. The developer and/or commercial business shall provide for maintenance of the storm water storage facilities such that they continue to operate as designed.\n\nThe requirement for construction of a storm water storage facility may be waived in the following cases:\n(1)The runoff has been included in a storage facility at another location;\n(2)Construction of only a single-family residential structure;\n(3)Development adjacent to a flood way or a drainage channel which has been determined by the Public Works Director, using engineering analyses provided by the developer, to have been designed and constructed to handle the additional runoff flow without increasing the potential for flood damage on any other downstream property; and\n(4)Development of a parcel under one-half acre in an area where it can be demonstrated by engineering analyses that no significant increase in the potential for flood damage will be created by the development.\n(c) Easements. Adequate easements must be dedicated for the construction and maintenance of any new or relocated drainage channels. All drainage easements to the City of Natchitoches shall be identified and dedicated as early as possible in the development process, but in no case shall a building permit be issued until the city has received and accepted the easement. The dedication instrument shall consist of a survey plat by a licensed professional Land Surveyor, with an accompanying legal description. The survey plat shall show the proposed easement, any existing drainage easements, any flood plain areas within the tract, and any existing drainage easements intersecting the proposed easement.\n(d) Flood run-off. Provisions shall be made for the best available routing of run-off water to assure that buildings or other important facilities will not be endangered by the path of major emergency flood run-off which would become active if the capacity of site?s storm drainage system is exceeded.\n\nSEC. 28.1-194. DRAINAGE SPECIFICATIONS\nWhere deemed necessary by the Public Works Director, subsurface drainage pipes, concrete curbs and gutters, catch basins, and culverts or bridges will be required.\n(a)The design and construction of all drainage facilities shall be made under the supervision and approval of a Civil Engineer currently licensed in the State of Louisiana.

The well will be put back in service as soon as samples are cleared by LDH. The utility department will begin flushing the water system as soon as Well #1 is put back online. A 6\" gate valve that was leaking on Well #1 was changed. There is a 6\" check valve inside of the chlorination room that is not holding but they are still capable of valving off the treatment plant using a valve in the well yard. This check valve can be changed in the future, probably during the next project at the well. The monthly Safe Drinking Water Act daily chlorine residual logs were verified by Todd Abshire and are on file in the utility office filing cabinet as required by law. WastewaterThe monthly flow records were faxed to HoPak Laboratories to verify flow in accordance with the discharge permit, as well as all analytical results being examined, reported and filed in the appropriate filing cabinet in the utility department files. GasThe gas system is operating near 40 pounds of inlet pressure at the Cypress Station and 40 psi at the Koch Station.

Further, Reinstated Provisional Patrol Officer Taylor Rials Bergeron changed her mind and resigned a second time also refusing to return in a Reserve Officer capacity. Since the Department is working with a skeleton crew he has sought and received the services of the Sheriff's Office to assist in manning three night shifts per week. Chief said that he is also filling in temporarily as needed. He asked the Council to increase the pay of Patrol Officers effective immediately as per recommendations, along with the suggestion of Mayor Todd Meche confirmed by his email of the past weekend. He applauds the Mayor's acknowledgement of a need for pay adjustments in aiding the efforts to recruit and retain candidates for a longer period, as well as bringing the department salaries closer to a living wage. It is recommended that starting pay for a Provisional Patrol Officer with no experience will be $10.58 per hour (Grade 2 step 7), after a probationary period of six months, depending on acceptable performance, pay will increase to $11.64 per hour (Grade 2 Step 15), and finally after graduation form POST Academy, upon recommendation, the pay will be $13.09 per hour (Grade 2 Step 26). 1) Chief petitioned the Council to approve the hiring of Mr. Curtis Chavis to the position of Provisional Patrol Officer at a pay rate of $10.58 per hour subject to the approval of the recommended pay schedule proposed. Should the proposed pay schedule pay be adopted. 2) Chief petitioned the Council to adjust the pay of Provisional Patrol Officer Shamar Smith to what is being offered to Mr. Chavis ($10.58 per hour). 3) Chief petitioned the Council to increase the pay rate of Provisional Patrol Officer Jacob Russo to $11.64 per hour since he has satisfactory completed six months service in his position in an acceptable manner. 4) Chief petitioned the Council to approve the hiring of Brody Pierrottie to the position of Night Dispatcher at a pay rate of $8.56 per hour. Chief intends to review the pay rates of all the Dispatchers and shall submit a pay rate adjustment for them at the next Council meeting.

Jamie said considering what was brought in front of the Council at the previous meeting from the Chief he also supports tabling. Chief said he is shorthanded dispatchers and they will be working a lot of overtime. Parks and RecreationZelma Jackson Zelma stated that registration is out for Baseball, and they are trying to finish the work on the dugouts. Some bids are being accepted for the fences. Willie Wyble Willie Wyble stated that he is having problems with the police department. He said that he requested a copy of a document that should have been completed on Saturday (Feb. 15, 2020) he requested the document on Monday morning (Feb. 17, 2020) he does not have what he requested. Mr. Wyble asked the chief if he had the report that he asked for, the Chief said no. Jamie asked what document Willie was inquiring about; Willie said it was a report of an incident that happened between him and Officer Jacob Russo. Willie asked the Chief if he had any idea when he would get the report, chief said this matter is being investigated. Willie said he is still under the impression that he can still get the document. Chief said he could not get the report due to it being under investigation. Willie said that Chief said that he called 911; Mr. Wyble said he went to the 911 office and he said the paper work that was given to him had absolutely nothing to do with 911. The paper work states that Willie made a phone call at 5:56 to the dispatcher Mrs. Richard he wants to know what phone number made the call, chief said if the dispatcher writes the number it will be in the log book. Willie told the chief the paper work has nothing to do with him. Jamie Huval asked what generated this matter and Willie stated he needed to find out from the chief. Willie also told the chief that the police department is being put on notice that when the department speaks to him in person or on the phone he will video and audio record any communication between them will be documented. Willie informed the Council that he went to St. Landry Parish and filed a complaint and that they will handle this matter. The Chief is required to do his part on this matter. He said that St. Landry will handle this matter but he will follow up on the matter. Kevin Robin asked Mr. Wyble for a copy of his documents. Jamie asked Mr. Wyble to give a briefing of what happened to him. Willie stated that he was taken off of his property. Jamie asked if he was arrested and Willie stated that he was and his Miranda Rights were read to him, and was handcuffed. He said that he was pulled off of his steps while sitting down. Jamie asked him if those were bruises and Willie stated it was. He also notified the Chief that when he is on his land and no laws have been broken neither the chief or his officers will remove him from his property. Kevin Robin asked Mr. Wyble why he was arrested. Mr. Wyble said according to Mr. Russo he was disobeying the direct orders of a police officer he needed to vacate his property. Jamie asked Willie why he was asked to vacate and Willie said that he would have to ask Mr. Russo. Jamie stated that is very troubling to hear a citizen like Mr. Wyble who volunteers at the Church for someone to be treated this way by the Police Department; he said that it is unfortunate that this council has been wrestling with so many issues with the department. Jamie stated that the police department has gone through numerous employees and was told it was due to the pay. Jamie stated that the council has upped the pay; the police officers know what the pay is when they take the positions. Jamie also stated that there is a problem with hostile work environment in the department; several of the police officers have spoken to the Council about complaints in the department. With that being said Jamie said that he is calling for the formal resignation of Chief Eddy LeCompte. FORMAL CALL FOR REQUEST OF CHIEF EDDY LCOMPTE'S RESIGNATION For the past six years, Chief Eddie LeCompte has served our town, and we are forever grateful for that sacrifice. However, within the last few years, particularly, last six months, this council's confidence in Chief Eddie LeCompte has diminished. Over the past several months the Council of the Town of Arnaudville as collected, what is believed to be, substantial evidence of numerous Exhibits proving that Chief Eddie LeCompte is no longer fit for the position of Chief of the Town of Arnaudville. These exhibits cover anywhere the thirty-eight employees we have lost under the leadership of this administration to the hostile work environment this administration has been accused of, the numerous lawsuits our town has been subjected to under this administration, as well as a lack of protection provided by the Arnaudville Police Department because the administration is unable to keep its department properly staffed. This council strongly believes that it is not only our fiduciary responsibility to the Town of Arnaudville, but also our responsibility to the staff members of the Arnaudville Police Department as well. Therefore, today, February 18, 2020, the council, as a whole and in unison, in representation with the people of Arnaudville asks for the formal resignation of Chief Eddie LeCompte. Respectfully signed: Jamie Huval Kevin Robin Cynthia Stelly Debbie Kidder Suzanne Stelly Jamie Huval asked Chief Eddie LeCompte is he would resign and Chief LeCompte said no. Jamie stated that in that case he is calling for a vote of confidence. A VOTE OF NO CONFIDNCE In the matter of Chief Eddie LeCompte, Chief LeCompte has no competence with money, no competence with managing his employees, no competence in retaining employees, no competence in running his department, no competence in working with the governing body, and no competence when hiring employees. With this being said, I Councilman Jamie Huval, on the 18th day of February, 2020, makes a motion that this council call for a vote of No Confidence on Chief Eddie LeCompte. Let it be known that while this vote cannot remove the Chief from office it shows that this governing body does not agree with his actions and decisions he has made as a leader of our community and most importantly we do not support him in these actions and decisions. However, let the record reflect that while this body has no confidence in the chief, we do fully support our officers and dispatchers who put their lives on the line daily to make sure that each of us can sleep soundly at night and we wish to continue a working relationship with each of them seconded by Debbie Kidder, motion passed. Jamie stated that he is on the Agenda for Police Department Solutions but unfortunately Sheriff Bobby Guidroz was not able to attend. Sheriff Guidroz will be at the next town meeting, Jamie asked the council to please consider the possibility of looking into the Sheriff coming into the Town of Arnaudville and replacing the police department, not replacing but taking a look at different avenues of protection. Chief LeCompte said he is aware of what Mr. Huval is implying; he said they have lost a number of police officers. He said that in his tenure of 5 years he lost police officers. Chief asked Shamar Smith what was his badge number and he answered 32. Chief said they started off with badge number 10, he said he now has police officers here that are still working. He has lost 19 officers in 5 years. He said he looks at this council and yes there have been employees who have gone to the council without going through him at no time has any of the council members gone to him and asked him for his reply on any problems. He feels this is a kangaroo court, he said he looks at the council as representatives of the town that are acting as a jury and as a jury the council should be open minded to both sides of any story. He said he has never been approached as to why he is doing what he is doing and what he has done and why he is doing it. He said his door is always open; he has no problem with someone approaching him. He said there is a discrepancy in pay, there is a discrepancy in not having insurance. He understands why officers have left because of better pay and insurance. He applauds the officers and understands. He said the officers work 12 hour shifts not 8 hour shifts, they do not get holidays because they have to work. Chief said he fills in whenever he possibly can and gets calls at all hours of the night. All of his employees have been told that they can come and talk with him. Chief stated that his budget is always under budget. All police business is confidential. The police department has to be unbiased; he would like to see the council members to be unbiased as well. Jamie stated that he would email chief with a list of line items. Jamie Huval moved to open the meeting to the public seconded by Cynthia Stelly, motion passed. Melanie Robin stated that she feels everyone is in attendance for the same reasons. Everyone has love for the Town of Arnaudville. Melanie said that she takes care of the law officers by providing food and drinks for all of them. Melanie said that she wonders why one police officer put their business on Face Book. She said they were victims of 2 crimes on a Saturday evening, she called the police department and she was told they could not do anything because it was out of their jurisdiction, but the crime happened in the town limits. Chief said that if a crime is committed in the town and do not live in town limits, the only thing he can do is take the report , write the report up and a cut a warrant to arrest that person. Melanie asked if the report was written and chief said no and the only thing he heard about the incident was that the officer searched for the person and could not find him. He knows who the person is that committed the crime. Chief said the officer went back and he was asked to leave the business. Melanie stated that this has not happened, no officer was ever asked to leave the premises. Melanie stated that the criminals need to be taken off of the streets and if they are told it is out of their jurisdiction what are they to do. She said they just have to be victims of crime for the seventh time. Melanie stated that she is not involved in insubordination and lies for anything with the store that she runs for 37 years. Kevin asked who the chief of police is; Melanie said she was the chief of police. Kevin said that the buck stops with the chief. Kevin said he has been in the room and Melanie was a victim of crime, he cannot tell him what this woman was subjected to. He said chief held the line and lied and said he does not have confidence in the chief. Kevin said that it is time for the foolishness to stop. He said the police department is not being run on a professional basis, he said he does not blame the police officers he blames the chief. Melanie stated that everyone needs to work together and that is not happening. Melanie said that perhaps both parishes should take over and protect the town. Kevin Robin thanked District Attorney Cravins for attending the regular town meeting. Mr. Cravins stated that he does not take sides but is happy he had attended. Jamie Huval moved to re-enter into the regular town meeting seconded by Debbie Kidder, motion passed.

He said that if the jail tax does not pass there will be serious problems. Mr. Stelly stated that he represents District 7 and if anyone needs anything that he can help with please call.

Chairman Irving Comeaux recognized the OHSEP Director, who stated that he received the request for a hardship variance at 105 Williams Street. He stated that they will be placing a mobile home at that address with 8 ft. setbacks on each side. He then explained that the mobile home is too large therefore, they are requesting that the home be placed 2 ft. from the side property line. He also stated that the neighbors have a submitted a letter of no objection. In response, he stated that the letter states the length of the home is 4 ft. less that the lot. In response to the liability this distance poses, the OHSEP Director and Juror Carter stated that that?s the reason the neighbors submit a letter of no objection. Police Juror Jamie Ponville stated that the Parish has an ordinance therefore, the Parish should decide if variances will be granted or not. In response, the Chairman stated that this was reviewed years ago and realized that each property is different and sometimes a variance may or may not work and a neighbor could be against it. Committee member Leroy Blanchard added that the neighbor?s insurance company should be required to submit a letter of ?No Objection? also since they would be responsible for the liability coverage. In response, the ADA stated that that has been his reply in the past just because the neighbors submit a letter of ?No Objection? they are not releasing of liability stating there would be any civil discourse relative to the neighbor being so close to their property. He also stated that he has recommended in the past that we need to make sure an inspection is done regarding everything that is being stated and submitted is true and accurate. Chairman Irving Comeaux stated that this request is the shortest distance that has ever been requested. In response, committee member Chris Carter stated that this has been an issue and also stated that a similar request has been approved by the Jury previously on several occasions, so it?s sad to say that approval is granted to some and not to others. He also stated that since his tenure, he has not seen anyone come in with a picture other than a map indicating what will be done He added that one of the lots on the side is empty. In response, the ADA stated that this is the kind of information that is needed and that is why an investigation is needed to make more sense to have further clarity on this particular issue He further stated that he has always recommended to stick to the ordinance. He added that now would be the appropriate time, with the new members, to decide how to proceed forward. A brief discussion was held regarding the neighbor being the property owner or renter, are they aware of what they are really agreeing to, whether or not to abide by the ordinance or grant variances, etc. The OHSEP Director stated that when the discussion transpired to amend the ordinance, he advised that the building code requires 10ft. between the structures so the person signing the ?No Objection? has to understand that they now have to be 10 ft. from that structure and may lose the use of some of their property because of their agreement. He stated that the suggestion was that if a variance was granted the neighbor should understand what it meant for them. A discussion was then held regarding the request for variances.\n\n3. Committee member Jeff Naquin offered a motion, ?THAT, the committee approve a hardship variance of the side property setbacks for a mobile home at 105 William St.? The motion died due to a lack of a second.\nChairman Irving Comeaux requested that the OHSEP Director investigate the property and that the Jury think about amending the ordinance, granting variances, or abiding by the current ordinance. Following another discussion, the matter will be discussed at the next meeting.\n\n4. Chairman Irving Comeaux recognized the Parish Engineer, who stated that he received 12 bids and the lowest bid being submitted by Thomassie Construction, Inc. The base bid was $262,400, alternate #1 addition of $19,950 and alternate #2 deduction of $13,300 for a total combined bid of $269,050. He then recommended approval. The OHSEP Director then stated that the original budget was $200,000 but after meeting with the Secretary-Treasurer, he increased the budget amount from the Special Industry fund to $230,000 and the Cities Readiness Initiative fund budget to $45,000 towards this project. He then recommended approval.\n\n5. Committee member Jeff Naquin offered a motion, seconded by Mr. Michael Dias, ?THAT, the committee approve and accept the lowest bid of $229,050 submitted by Thomassie Construction, Inc. for the Emergency Response Equipment Warehouse.? The motion was unanimously adopted.\n\n6. Chairman Irving Comeaux recognized Police Juror Leroy Blanchard, who stated that he was approached by the landowner on 1st St. who also has an interest in forming a drainage district. He stated that the water on that street is backing up under the culvert onto their property. He stated that he went inspect the area and thinks that an elevation needs to be taken. He then stated that he spoke with the Parish Manager and the Parish Engineer regarding the problem. Following a brief discussion, the committee agreed to allow the Parish Manger to shoot the elevation of 1st St.\n\n7. Chairman Irving Comeaux recognized the OHSEP Director, who stated that the Cancienne Canal bids are being received on tomorrow. They are hauling dirt in the ponds and are half way done in the main pond. He then stated that they are awaiting the generators.\n\n8.

He then gave the decibel allowances for other parishes which ranged from 50-70 except in St. Martin which is 3 from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. and 5 from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Mr. Talbot then stated that the Sheriff sends a deputy out to the club and recommends that the music be lowered and it was being done but that good gesture has stopped. He stated that 9 calls have been made since the beginning of the year. He also stated that the business owner gave Mrs. Allen his phone number so he can be contacted if the music was too loud and that transpired a while but then he stopped responding. He also stated that this action will affect the property value if she considered selling. He further stated that he would like the Jury to pay as much attention to this matter as did to the mobile home variance.\nIn response, President Jeff Naquin stated that a similar issue transpired in the Paincourtville community and the Jury personally did a decibel meter exercise with the Sheriff?s Office and they came up with the 80 decibels. He then stated that he?s not sure if it needs tweeking. In response, Mr. Talbot stated that the decibel reading during the complaint when taken is about 64 decibels. In response, Juror Ron Alcorn reiterated on the drill that was taken in the Paincourtville community and stated that it was well thought of when the ordinance was revised. Police Juror Patrick Johnson stated that at the January 16, 2016 meeting changes were proposed and recommendations were made. He then stated that in April of 2016 the policy was adopted with the aid of the ADA and the Sheriff. He added that he visited the establishment on this week due to this present discussion and didn?t find the music to be in violation and he spoke with the Sheriff and obtained copies of all complaints that had been received. He added that the owner has stated that the base has been lowered or taken it out completely. He stated that the owner has done several things to rectify the problem/complaints and listed them. A brief discussion was then held regarding the sound and the ordinance. President Jeff Naquin recognized LaQuentin Davis, business owner, who stated that he has spoken with his DJ and asked that the volume or base be lowered due to the complaints received. Mrs. Linda Allen informed the Jury that the deputies admitted that they wouldn?t be able to sleep with the sound that is heard. President Jeff Naquin stated that the Police Jury responsibility to the residents of the Parish is to ensure a good quality of life. He stated that the ordinance stated 80 decibels and the owner is trying to satisfy the neighbors as best as he can so he opened the floor to suggestions. In response, the ADA stated that those areas are different (rural versus downtown). He advised that the Police Jury not jump into anything tonight because the Jury did substantial work when this matter was proposed. He then recommended that the matter be taken under consideration. He added that at a certain point, this will become a civil matter and the Jury will be able to do only so much. Therefore, he suggested that the parties communicate as best as possible to eliminate a suit from occurring. Following a brief discussion, President Jeff Naquin stated that no actions will be taken and the matter will be revisited at a later date. He then suggested that Mr. Davis and Mrs. Allen exchange numbers again to have current contact.\n\n17. President Jeff Naquin stated that a law firm contacted the Sheriff and he contacted the Jury suggesting that we may consider getting on board with Leger Law firm. The ADA stated that he reviewed the contract and has no objection to it.\n\n18. Police Juror Ron Alcorn offered a motion, seconded by Mr. Chris Carter, ?THAT, the Police Jury approve and adopt a resolution to obtain special counsel for Opioid-related claims and approve a contract with legal counsel Walter Leger, Jr. Leger & Shaw Attorneys & Counselors.? The motion was unanimously adopted. (resolution attached)\n\n19. President Jeff Naquin stated that the Parish currently pays 5 mills for the Atchafalaya Basin Levee District but he?s suggesting that we re-dedicate 2.5 mills to assisting to fund the ongoing Bayou Chene Maintenance costs. He stated that the process has to be done by Legislation. In response, Police Juror Myron Matherne stated that when he meets with Representative Rick Ward he will discuss the Parish?s suggestion.\n\n20. Police Juror Myron Matherne offered a motion, seconded by Mr. Leroy Blanchard, ?THAT, the Police Jury approve adoption of a resolution to the Legislative Delegation for re-allocation of a portion of the existing tax millage of 2.5 mills for the Atchafalaya Basin Levee District to assist with the ongoing Bayou Chene Maintenance costs.? The motion was unanimously adopted, (resolution)\n\n21. Police Juror Jamie Ponville offered a motion, seconded by Mr. Irving Comeaux, ?THAT, the Police Jury approve an occupational license for Kouture Khaos Kloset and Beth?s Custom Creations.? The motion was unanimously adopted.\n\n22. President Jeff Naquin recognized Police Juror Chris Carter, who stated that the visibility of the stripping on La. Highway 1 at night is horrible therefore, he is requesting that a letter be sent to the Department of Transportation and Development to re-strip LA 1 from the Ascension Parish Line to the Lafourche Parish line. He requested that a letter be sent to Representative Ed Price and Chad Brown requesting their support.\n\n23. Police Juror Chris Carter offered a motion, seconded by Mr. Michael Dias, ?THAT, the Police Jury approve a letter to DOTD requesting they consider the re-stripping of LA 1 from the Ascension Parish Line to the Lafourche Parish line and the Legislative Delegation requesting support.?
