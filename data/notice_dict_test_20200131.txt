To discuss and possibly taken action to the damage at the Rapides Parish Highway Department and other Departments. Laurel Smith, Secretary Rapides Parish Police Jury There were present: Theodore Fountaine, Jr., President, Oliver \"Ollie\" Overton, Vice President, and Police Jurors; Davron \"Bubba\" Moreau, Craig Smith, Joe Bishop, Richard Vanderlick Jr., Sean McGlothlin, Richard Billings and Scott: Perry, Jr. Also present were Mr. Bruce Kelly, Treasurer; Chief Joesph Glorioso, Fire District No. 2; Ms. Sonya Wiley-Gremillion, OHSEP Director; Shane Trapp, Courthouse and Building Superintendent; Elaine Morace, OEWD Director; Donna Andries, Sales & Use Tax; Dennis Woodward, Public Works Director; Linda Sanders, Civil Service Director; Greg Jones, Legal Counsel and Ms. Laurel Smith, Secretary. The invocation was given by Mr. Richard Billings. The Pledge of Allegiance was led by Mr. Joe Bishop. The Police Jury of the Parish of Rapides, State of Louisiana, was duly convened as the governing authority of said Parish by Hon. Theodore Fountaine, Jr., President, who welcomed all present and then stated that the Police Jury was ready for the transaction of business. The President asked if there was any public comment on any agenda item, to which there was no response. On motion by Mr. Richard Billings, seconded by Mr. Bubba Moreau, to discuss and possibly take action on the damage at the Rapides Parish Highway Department and other Departments. Mr. Dennis Woodward, Public Works Director, stated the widespread damage that the tornado did at the Highway Department barn and all of the damages to the structures and the equipment and vehicles. They do have a generator running at the sign shop. Mr. Greg Jones, Legal Counsel, stated that they did a walk through the building. He checked with the National Weather Service and the tornado was classified as an E3, which is means it sustained winds of 140 to 180 miles per hour. There were three categories of damages. Wind damage, pressure damage and water damage. The insurance adjustors will start doing an assessment on the property damage and the contents damage. It was a miracle that no one was seriously injured. Mr. Bruce Kelly stated England Authority was contacted and they have a building comparable to ours that they would rent to us for $1250 a month. It has offices in the front, shop in the back and can go month to month on the rent. The England Authority has a meeting tomorrow at 4:30 pm and will have an item on their agenda. Mr. Jones recommend that an item be added for an Emergency Declaration due to the condition of the Highway Department barn. It should be covered under the Governor's Declaration, but he would like for the Jury to do a separate one. Also, if you do have a facility in mind and you want to give a preliminary approval for it, subject to Legal Counsel's review and the approval of the Parish Engineer that would be appropriate under the emergency declaration if we adopt that first. He further stated they were going to meet tomorrow with the insurance company and probably with in fifteen days, will have a compilation of the damage items list and have the clerk email it to all of you, so you can see what we are looking at damage wise on structure and on the vehicles. Mr. Bruce Kelly stated they had talked to the Sheriff's Office and there are men out there from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm. He also stated the Parish has Business Interruption Rider coverage, so there is money to pay for the rental of the building and it won't be out of pocket, plus the security is covered under this. Mr. Ollie Overton requested Ms. Sonya Wiley, OHSEP Director, to give a briefing of the Governor's visit. Ms. Sonya Wiley stated that the Governor wanted to get an aerial view and eyes on the ground of the degree and magnitude of damage. The Governor stated that the biggest thing right now is life, safety and getting us back as whole as we can, to provide the services to the public. Ms. Wiley gave a brief description of the damages and what assistance the Parish will get and the purpose of the Governor's visit. She stated it is extremely that each and every expense be captured, such as overtime, use of the equipment, clean up, anything that it takes to put us back in operation for day to day business. Discussion ensued. On motion by Mr. Scott Perry, seconded by Mr. Bubba Moreau, to add to the agenda an Emergency Declaration and a lease proposal at England Airpark.

Todd Abshire is working on a water and wastewater rate study as requested by the Mayor; Todd is hoping to have an update during the month of February. Mayor Meche stated that the drainage project on East Street is moving forward. Police ReportEddy LeCompte Provisional Patrol Officer Jacob Russo began attending the St. Martin POST Academy Tuesday, January 21, 2019. He will be in training for the next fourteen weeks. He intends to conduct a Neighborhood Watch meeting during the month of March, he will let the Council know when a date has been set. He is preparing for the upcoming Etouffee Festival to be held on April 24, 25 and 26, 2020. He will review what was done last year to see if improvements can be made. Should any Council or Community member have an idea to enhance the Festival experiences please let the Police Department know. Chief applauded the Mayor on replacing the ramp at the entrance of the Police Department office. The Mayor has assured the Chief that the necessary remodeling of the restroom is being looked into in order to be in compliance with ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) regulations. The Department was informed that there may be grants available to address the necessary construction work to be done. Without this construction being done he will be prevented from being eligible to receive any government grants. He petitioned the Council to approve the hiring of Mr. Shamar Smith to the position of Provisional Patrol Officer at a starting pay of $9.93 per hour (Grade 2 Step 2). Mr. Smith will still need to have a drug screen and physical (passing both) before he will be allowed to begin working full time, on the clock. Concerning drugs screens and physicals, he would like the Council to approve that in the future these can be done prior to asking for approval to hire. As you are aware before approval to hire has been requested a Patrol Officer candidate must pass a four (4) hour psychological exam, be approve for insurance by Risk Management, and have a background check done. If the drug screen and physical can be done during this pre-employment phase then the candidate could begin working as soon as approval is made to hire them. The only delay that might be caused is if the candidate must give their current employer notice before leaving. Statistics for the Arnaudville Police Department for the month of December 2020: 23 Citations, 0 FIC's, 4 MIC's, 7 arrests made, 109 calls for service. Two (2) individuals were chosen as Employees of the year for 2019. The Dispatcher chosen for Employee of the year was Ms. Taylor Rials while the Patrol Officer was Mr. Jacob Russo. These employees did an outstanding job during 2019. Mayor Meche asked the Chief to furnish him with any information he has on the grant he applied for. Suzanne Stelly moved to hire Shamar Smith to the position of Provisional Patrol officer at a starting pay of $9.93 per hour (Grade 2 Step 2) seconded by Kevin Robin, motion passed. Chief asked the board to consider doing the drug screening and physical before hiring takes place. Mayor stated that his position unless the Council approves this, he would not allow this because if someone is sent to do these tests before approval and pays for this, if the Council votes not to hire them the town would be paying for a non-existing employee. Parks and RecreationZelma Jackson (Absent) Mayor explained that all is going well at the park. Accept Bids for La Hwy, 31 Water ImprovementsMayor (Bihm Construction $48.837.00-E.B. Feucht & Sons, LLC $45,610.00-Elliott Construction, LLC $51.830.00) Jamie Huval moved to accept the low bid of Bihm Construction in the amount of $48.837.00 seconded by Debbie Kidder, motion carried. St. Landry Solid WasteExecutive Director Mr. Richard LeBouef Mr. Richard explained that he is trying to be pro-active and explained to the Mayor and Board what is going to take place in the future with Solid Waste. Mr. LeBouef touched base on the many different options, the trash pick-up will go from twice a week to once a week, and it is not decided on what day of the week this will take place just yet. Everyone will be notified. He said he will be as diligent as possible and appreciate what everyone does for them. Up-DateMayor Meche Mayor said that he has discussed with the board about the disposal of the old Museum building he spoke with Mr. Ken Douet, Kevin Robin also spoke with Mr. Douet. Mr. Douet wants to take the building and have it moved to the Stephanie Plantation. In a few days he (Mr. Douet) will be signing a contract with a mover. Mayor Meche explained that the generators have been serviced and maintenance needs to be done. The nursing home generator and the generator on St. Landry Street are having problems with the injector pumps. Mayor suggested having the pumps re-built at a cost of $15,012.00. Debbie Kidder moved to have the injector pumps repaired at the cost of $15,012.00 seconded by Cynthia Stelly, motion passed. Mayor said that he and Kenny are looking at a few of the major pot holes that need fixing; Kenny is looking into getting someone to repair these holes. Mayor stated that some of the roads are not patchable and he would like to put a couple of the streets in the budget for overlay. Kevin Robin explained how the De Bayou Organization would help with projects within the town. Mardi Gras Ball will be held February 8, 2020. Citizens' Concerns Officer Jacob Russo and Officer Jair Stelly expressed their concerns about the Arnaudville Police Department. Mayor explained that the pay of the Arnaudville Police Department is the chief's responsibility and the board votes on what he brings up to the board. Jamie Huval explained that they (the board) are not responsible for what the officers are getting paid; he said if Chief would go up to him he feels he can speak for the board on this matter. He feels they would all start hiring the police officers at $11.00 an hour. Jamie said that the first job he had he was making $9.00 an hour and he was not risking his life. He said he supports the police officers but he has a problem with the way the chief runs his department. Jamie said that he and the board would give the officers a raise in a heartbeat, but the chief does not come to the Council. Chief is supposed to have 5 officers, from what Jamie understands the Chief cannot make a schedule. The Police Department has the manpower to have 2 officers on duty, maybe not every night. A brief discussion was held. Adjourn Suzanne Stelly moved to adjourn the January 2020 Regular Town Meeting seconded by Jamie Huval, motion passed. Attest Dolores R.

In summary, Fenstermaker has completed the survey and provided to Energy Transfer for review and use. Once they have a draft scope, they will work to obtain proper drawings and documentation for use in permit applications to all required agencies. Energy Transfer is committed to resolution, so once they obtain all necessary permits their last obstacle will be weather; it will control when they execute.\nRegarding the Cameron Parish Shoreline Protection Project, Kara Bonsall stated that the Police Jury?s mission is to continue shoreline protection projects for all of the beaches assigned to the project (Rutherford Beach, Long Beach, and Little Florida Beach.)\nRutherford Beach will be the first phase of the project, and bids will open Tuesday, December 10th. The Police Jury is committed to continue finding funding for all phases of the project.\nMark McCombs spoke with the DOTD engineer about the concrete barriers shoreline protection project at Mile Marker 22. The first step will be to get a joint agreement between the parish and state. The project would include 1,000 ft. of shoreline to the east and 100 ft. to the west of the current barriers to prevent sand from blowing across the road as well as to build sand dunes for wildlife (nesting birds, turtles, etc.) The parish is responsible for all transportation, machinery, and manpower for the project. Once a cost analysis is completed, the board will present its findings to the police jury for their approval.\nRegarding the dumpsters placed at the Sabine Pass and Cameron Ferry boat launches, Lisa Hunt reported that they have been successful in helping keep those areas clean. On the motion of Terry Burroughs, seconded by Mark McCombs, and carried, an additional three-month contract will be made with Waste Management to service these locations.\nLisa Hunt gave an update on the production of twenty-five Rip Current Warning signs from Graphic Works, which has been delayed. Once they are delivered, a board member will ride with the road crew to mark placement of the signs.\nMark McCombs reported that the sub-committee for the Beachfront Development District #1 Coastal Development Master Plan met and discussed possible projects. The next meeting is TBA. On the motion of Terry Burroughs, seconded by Richard Burbank, and carried, Russell Badon will be added to the sub-committee.\nKara Bonsall reported that the placement of 4X4 fencing posts on the beach was a CWPRA project.

He has acquired the necessary DOTD application, has gotten in touch with sign companies, and should have something to present to the board by the next meeting.\nSonny McGee inquired about 2020 funding needs for Beachfront Development District #1. Board members explained that this year money has been spent in three areas: signs, dumpsters and Port-a-lets, with an operating cost of approximately $10,000. The topic concerning an ad valorem tax under the authority of Article VI, Section 30 of the Constitution of Louisiana was discussed, but no recommendation was given. Sonny McGee will put Beachfront Development District #1 funding on the next Police Jury Meeting agenda for discussion.\nSheriff Ron Johnson reported on the department?s help in addressing problems on the beaches. He asked for the public to work in coordination with the Sheriff?s Department by taking pictures and/or video of incidents of gross littering, riding on the dunes, and speeding on the beaches. If deputies have this evidence, they will be able to issue tickets. Also, a beach patrol will monitor on busy weekends and holidays.\nLyndsey Howell, a biologist with NOAA Fisheries, presented information regarding sea turtle and dolphin strandings and salvage. She asks that the public report any dead, injured or entangled animals to 1-877-942-5343. In March, Lyndsey will return every two weeks to research why sea turtles and marine mammals are stranding in this area, and she is looking for volunteers who will take a certification class through Fish and Wildlife Services to help in documentation by checking for tags, taking measurements, and salvaging remains.\nLisa Hunt reported that the Gravity Drainage District #7 meeting will be January 29 at 5:00 p.m. to discuss the Holly Beach Drainage Project with engineers.\nThe next Beachfront Development meeting will be Monday, January 20 at 6:00 p.m.\nNathan Haase with the Bechtel team thanked the group for their coat donations, and he is setting up another boat launch clean-up at the Texas/Louisiana border.\nNo bills needed payment.\nThere being no further business, on the motion of Mark McCombs, seconded by Terry Burroughs, and carried the meeting was adjourned at 7:13 p.m.\nAPPROVED BY:\nLISA HUNT, CHAIRMAN\nATTEST BY:\nMICHELE LONG, SECRETARY\nRUN: Jan. 30 (J 36)"}}, "Allen": {"1": {"paper": "Kinder Courier-News", "date": "20200130", "text": "PUBLIC NOTICE\nALLEN PARISH RECREATION DISTRICT NO. 6\nADVERTISEMENT\nFOR BIDS\nAllen Parish Recreation\nDistrict #6\nc/o West Allen Parish Water District\n18196 Hwy. 190\nReeves, LA 70658\nSeparate sealed Bids for Allen Parish Recreation District #6, Contract B - Track; M.A. Project No. A1-17047-DB will be received by the Allen Parish Recreation District #6, at the West Allen Parish Water District Office, 18196 Hwy. 190, Reeves, LA 70658 until 10:00 AM, on February 14, 2020, and then at said time and at said office publicly opened and read aloud.

Where disinfection is used in the treatment of drinking water, disinfectants combine with naturally occurring organic and inorganic matter present in water to form chemicals called disinfection byproducts (DBPs). EPA and LDH set standards for controlling the levels of disinfectants and DBPs in drinking water, including trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acid (HAAs). Some people who drink water containing THMs in excess of the MCL over many years may experience problems with their liver, kidneys, or central nervous system, and may have an increased risk of getting cancer.\nIn December 1998, EPA set enforceable drinking water standards for TTHMs at 80 parts per billion (ppb) and for HAA5 at 60 parts per billion (ppb) to reduce the risk of cancer or other adverse health effects. Compliance with the TTHMs and HAA5 standard for public water systems serving less than 10,000 individuals initially became effective and enforceable on January 1, 2004. Compliance with the TTHMs standard is determined by calculating a locational running annual average (LRAA) of quarterly TTHMs sample results. Compliance calculations performed for the fourth quarter of 2019 show that the system?s current TTHMs LRAAs are 137 ppb at DBP02-LULA LANE and 174 ppb at DBP03-SPRINGFIELD ROAD; Thus, the systems is currently in violation of the TTHMs standard.\nPlease share this information with all the other people who drink this water, epically those who may not have received this notice directly (for example, people in apartments, nursing homes, schools, and businesses). You can do this by posting this notice in a public place or distributing copies by hand or mail.\nThis is not an emergency. If it had been, you would have been notified immediately. EPA and LDH do not consider this violation to have any serious adverse health effects on human health as a result of short-term exposure; however, continued long-term exposure to TTHMs and HAA5 levels above the standard (e.g., 20 years of exposure) has the potential to have serious adverse effects on human health.\nSouth DeSoto Water System, Inc. 318/872-4065\nShould you have any questions, please call La.

This is an\nannouncement that is read aloud into the Minutes that satisfies the legal\nrequirement; so, that at the January 2020 Board meeting, the election can\nbe considered in the East District to authorize additional General Obligation\nBonds for capital purposes. In connection with that possible election\ncall at the January 2020 Board meeting, there will be an amount of bonds\nthat will not require any projected increase in the current tax rate being\npaid by the property tax payers. If the Board elects to submit a bond proposition\nat the January 2020 meeting, there would be no projected increase\nin the existing tax rate. Whereby, Greg Manley moved, seconded by Dabo\nGraves, that the Board approve the \ufffdPublic Announcement\ufffd as read aloud\nby President Hicks to consider adopting a resolution ordering and calling\nan election to be held in East Ouachita Parish School District of the Parish\nof Ouachita, State of Louisiana to authorize the issuance of general obligation\nbonds. President Hicks offered public comment and motion carried\nby all members present. Absent: Mr. Waggoner & Rev. Russell.\nBusiness Director Regina Mekus presented the monthly 2018-19 Interim\nFinancial Report for the Period ended October 31, 2019. Ms. Mekus\nreported the year to date revenue for the General Fund was $41,444,661,\nabout 28% of the budgeted revenue for the year, which brings us into about\n25% of the current year. The expenditures year to date are $33,908,998\nor about 23% of our budgeted expenditures in the General Fund for the\nyear. Our current ending fund balance is $28,109,813, about 102% of the\nprojected fund balance, which is in line with our expectations for the year.\nThe District M&O one-half cent taxes budgeted revenue for the year is\n$1.3 million and expenditures for the year are $3,942,096. You will notice\nthat revenues are up about 47% compared to this same time last year, the\ndifference is due to a large drainage project at West Ouachita High School\nthat had to be completed that accounted for about $300,000 in addition\nto purchasing buses early in the year. Everything else is performing according\nto expectations. The Debt Service Funds in the West Ouachita\nSchool District Bonds are running 87% of our expenditures for the year,\nbasically due to our bond payments for the year. These payments are made\nearly in the year, so it is expected to see these percentages somewhat higher\nin that district, but as the year progresses, that percentage would decrease\nas that number remains constant. Ms. Mekus pointed out that the content\nof the last two pages are a recap of the General Fund and the School\nDistrict M&O Sales Tax. The revenues and expenditures on the last two\npages consist of the recap of the beginning and the ending fund balances\nfor the fiscal year as compared to the monthly accumulation of revenues\nand expenditures to prior fiscal year periods. The General Fund and M&O\npercentage change from last year to this year are running close. The percentage\nchange in the General Fund balance from this time last year is\n2.41% and the M&O fund balance is a negative -3.45% hit early in the\nyear, but should recover as the year goes on. Following her report, Ms.\nMekus offered the Board an opportunity to ask questions, whereby, Tommy\nComeaux moved, seconded by Shere May, that the Board approve the\n2018-19 Interim Financial Report for the Period ended October 31, 2019\nas presented by Business Director Regina Mekus.

His question was would he be able to opt out of this as being not in the city limits, is this possible?\n\nMayor Posey stated from what he knows about it. Once the larger annexation fell apart from the meeting several months ago, he thought it was over with, but the people who wanted to be annexed in said if we want to be annexed in, what do we need to do? With that said, he stated we aren?t going to let one house in and one house out. The group in the middle, some still want in, but we had to take a section and do it that way. There have been some people out there who have told them some stuff that wasn?t exactly right and got everyone turned around on it. WE are going to move forward as this is how it was presented to us. If the numbers are there, it will move forward as is.\n\nMr. Harris asked, do you know how many households is in that?\n\nMayor Posey stated he did not have the number, but it was based on the number of petitioners recorded at the Assessor?s Office.\n\nTommy Murchison stated Mr. Harris was welcome to come by his office and view the map to go over.\n\nKaren Apponey asked, so there was actually a petition for that area we are talking about now that?s going to come in?\n\nMayor Posey stated he presumed that was what was being presented.\n\nMrs. Apponey then asked was this the original petition that was turned in in October?\n\nTommy Murchison stated the petition was modified by people stating their stance either for or against the petition.\n\nMrs. Apponey asked if she could come by Mr. Murchison?s office to obtain a copy of the map of which Mr. Murchison confirmed.\n\nMargaret Thomas of 157 Von Orange Lane stated there were a couple different petitions going around. One petition recommended by the previous mayor was to change our vote. We?ve received all kinds of promises about a new road and sewer changes with a connect fee provided by a grant from Waterworks District #1. There is a breakdown in what we will save, but then there are things that are not the same as what were on their paper. Also, it doesn?t mentioned anything about a sewer project, like who pays for the sewer. She believes there is a lot of missing information. She then asked if the letter she received was presented to everyone or not. Annex advantages which include a breakdown of what we will pay and the taxes, what we?ll save on our fire insurance estimated to be $100 and $180 savings on the water rate. Right now she pays $13.50 for water and sewer which appears to be from 2017.\n\nMayor Posey stated he was not aware of the letter she is presenting tonight. The things he answered were the sewer is not going to be forced upon anybody. It?s not fair for someone who puts in a new system to start paying a new rate so he mentioned he is not certain the sewer improvements would be anytime soon. He stated the road would happen immediately as the previous contractors committed to staying with the same price. In the near future, we would need to put in fire hydrants for protection within the next 2-3 years. It would have to be a majority vote of the people in this area on the sewer improvements.\n\nMr. Harrington stated he has heard a lot of people state, well we don?t have that in writing. He then stated, well the property is grandfathered in and you are protected by the code of ordinances.\n\nEllis Newman of 385 Monroe Drive stated his question is, it is my understanding there is a section that is not going be annexed in and if that is correct then how does that impact those that are wanting the road, street lights or other things? Will there be a delay for those that do want annexation in because there is a section that does not?\n\nMayor Posey stated there are people in that middle section that would like to come in and in my opinion they were led by some misinformation out there so we let them out, but the people who wanted in if were allowed if in a contiguous area.

and\nWHEREAS FURTHER, a subdivision plat was prepared by Robert Lynn Davis, dated August 4, 2017, a copy of which is recorded at Map Slide 772B, Original Instrument number 399293, (sometimes hereinafter ?Davis Plat?); and\nWHEREAS FURTHER, the Davis Plat depicts three tracts of ground on the Northeast end of the Parent tract as well as a proposed 80 foot wide street right of way along the Northwest boundary of the Parent Tract; and\nWHEREAS FURTHER, the City conveyed a portion of the Parent Tract, being a 15.0 acre tract shown and depicted as Tract 1 on the Davis Plat, together with a right of way for access and utilities across the proposed 80 foot street right of way (said Tract 1 and associated rights of way sometimes hereinafter referred to as ?Subject Property?) to Ledet?s Louisiana Seafood, L.L.C. by Transfer of Property, Right of Way, Option and Right of First Refusal recorded January 26, 2018, at Conveyance Book 717, page 697 of the records of Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana; and\nWHEREAS FURTHER, it was the stated intent of Ledet to locate a caviar production facility on the Subject Tract and a portion of the consideration for the transfer from the City to Ledet was the anticipated industrial development through the construction of a caviar production facility on the subject property which would lead to the creation of jobs and other benefits in the City of Natchitoches; and\nWHEREAS FURTHER, in order to insure that the caviar production facility would be constructed, the deed recorded at Conveyance Book 717 page 697 included an option in favor of the City to repurchase the subject property for $57,500.00 in the event that Ledet did not begin the production of caviar within two years of the date that the deed was executed; and\nWHEREAS FURTHER, more than two years have expired since the date that the deed in favor of Ledet was executed by Lee Posey on behalf of the City and caviar production has not begun on the Subject Property, and in fact no construction of any kind has taken place on the property; and\nWHEREAS FURTHER, Ledet is a Louisiana limited liability company with multiple members, and one of the members has requested additional time within which to begin caviar production, and the City is inclined to allow additional time, through the end of December 2020, provided that the Option to Purchase in its favor is extended; and\nWHEREAS FURTHER, while the City desires to provide the additional time period, the other members of Ledet have set certain requirements before they will agree to an extension of the Option to Purchase in favor of the City; and\nWHEREAS FURTHER, because of the short period remaining before the Option expires, the City Council desires to be prepared to act timely in any eventuality and does therefore desire to authorize the Mayor to exercise the Option to Purchase in favor of the City and Repurchase the Subject property from Ledet, or in the event that the requirements of all members of Ledet are met, to execute an Extension of the Option in favor of the City; and\nNOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED by the City Council of the City of Natchitoches, in legal session convened, that in the event that all requirements of all members of Ledet are not met, then in that event, the Mayor of the City of Natchitoches, Lee Posey, is authorized to exercise its Option to Repurchase the Subject Property and all documents that may be necessary to repurchase the Subject Property in accordance with the terms of the Transfer of Property, Right of Way, Option and Right of First Refusal recorded January 26, 2018, at Conveyance Book 717, page 697 of the records of Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana.\nBE IT FURTHER ORDAINED by the City Council of the City of Natchitoches, in legal session convened, that in the event that all requirements of all members of Ledet are met, then in that event, the Mayor of the City of Natchitoches, Lee Posey, is authorized to execute an Extension of the Option to Repurchase the Subject Property and all documents that may be necessary to Extend the Option to repurchase the Subject Property.\nBE IT FURTHER ORDAINED that Lee Posey, Mayor of the City of Natchitoches, be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to execute any other documents that may be necessary to complete the above.\nBE IT FURTHER ORDAINED that the City Clerk be authorized to advertise this proposed conveyance in accordance with law.\nMayor Posey stated the group trying to do this was unable to put everything together in a timely manner for the City to offer an extension, so a decision was made to no longer move forward with the project. In the agreement, the City had the first right of refusal to purchase the property back should it not move forward and that is what has been decided. While there has been some other interest in the property, the City will only move forward should a project be presented that would benefit the City of Natchitoches from an economic development standpoint.?\n\nThe following Ordinance was introduced by Mr. Harrington at the Natchitoches City Council meeting held on December 27, 2019 as follows:\n\nORDINANCE NUMBER 059 OF 2019\n\nAN ORDINANCE APPROVING THE ACQUISITION OF A TRACT OF LAND SITUATED IN SECTION 138, TOWNSHIP 9 NORTH, RANGE 7 WEST, FROM CHESTER CORLEY, FOR THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THREE DOLLARS, AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF NATCHITOCHES, LEE POSEY, TO EXECUTE A CASH SALE DEED ON BEHALF OF THE CITY FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE TRACT AND TO EXECUTE ANY AND ALL OTHER RELATED DOCUMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY AND PROPER, TO PROVIDE FOR ADVERTISING, AND A SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\nWHEREAS, Chester Corley (sometimes hereinafter referred to as ?Corley?) is the owner of a certain tract of land situated in Section 138, Township 9 North, Range 7 West, which tract is to the Northeast of Parc Natchitoches, and which tract is more fully described as follows, to-wit:\n\nTHAT CERTAIN TRACT OR PARCEL OF GROUND, together with all buildings and improvements located thereon, being situated and located in the Parish of Natchitoches, State of Louisiana, and being more particularly described as Lot 1 of the Cook-Watson-Breazeale Addition, as per plat of survey recorded in Conveyance Book 183, page 642 of the Records of Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, located in Section 81, Township 9 North, Range 7 West, containing 26.54 acres, more or less.\n\nLESS AND EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING TRACTS:\n\n1.

The said income and revenues are hereby irrevocably and irrepealably pledged in an amount sufficient for the payment of the Bonds in principal and interest as they fall due, and the income and revenues thus pledged shall remain so pledged for the security of the Bonds in principal and interest until they shall have been fully paid and discharged.\n\nSECTION 8. Rate Covenant; Funds and Accounts. The Issuer, through its Governing Authority, covenants to fix, establish and maintain such rates and collect such fees, rents or other charges for the services and facilities of the System, and all parts thereof, and to revise the same from time to time whenever necessary, as will always provide revenues in such year sufficient to pay the reasonable and necessary expenses of operating and maintaining the System in such year, the principal and interest falling due on the Bonds in such year, all reserve and sinking fund and other payments required for such year by this Ordinance and all other obligations or indebtedness payable out of the revenues of the System for such year, and which will provide revenues in each year, after paying all reasonable and necessary expenses of administering, operating and maintaining the System in such year, at least equal to 120% of the largest amount of principal and interest maturing in any future fiscal year on the Bonds and on any Parity Obligations hereafter issued as provided herein in any future year. The Issuer further covenants:\n\nThat all of the income and revenues derived or to be derived by the Issuer from the operation of the System shall be deposited as the same may be collected in a separate and special bank account heretofore established and maintained with the regularly designated fiscal agent bank of the Issuer, and designated as the \ufffdElectric Utility System Fund\ufffd(the \ufffdRevenue Fund\ufffd), said Fund to be maintained and administered in the following order of priority and for the following express purposes:\n\n(a) The payment of all reasonable and necessary expenses of operating and maintaining the System.\n\n(b) The establishment and maintenance of the \ufffdElectric Utility Revenue Bond and Interest Sinking Fund\ufffd (the \ufffdSinking Fund\ufffd), sufficient in amount to pay promptly and fully the principal of and the interest on the Bonds and any Parity Obligations issued hereafter in the manner provided by this Ordinance by transferring from the Revenue Fund to the fiscal agent of the Issuer monthly in advance on or before the 20th day of each month of each year, a sum equal to the principal and interest accruing on said debt obligations for such calendar month together with such additional proportionate sum as may be required to pay said principal and interest as the same respectively become due. If Parity Obligations are hereafter issued by the Issuer in the manner provided in this Ordinance, moneys in the Sinking Fund shall be equally available to pay principal and interest on such Parity Obligations. Said fiscal agent bank shall transfer from the Sinking Fund to any paying agent or pay directly to the registered owner, for all bonds payable from the said Sinking Fund, at least one (1) day in advance of the date on which each payment of principal or interest falls due, funds fully sufficient to pay promptly the principal and/or interest so falling due on such date.\n\n(c) The establishment and maintenance of the \ufffdElectric Utility Revenue Bond Reserve Fund\ufffd (the \ufffdReserve Fund\ufffd), by transferring from the Revenue Fund to the Reserve Fund monthly in advance on the 20th day of each month, commencing the first month following the completion of the Project, a sum at least equal to twenty percent (20%) of the amount to be paid in such month into the Sinking Fund, the payments into the Reserve Fund to continue until such time as there has been accumulated therein a sum equal to the Reserve Fund Requirement. The money in the Reserve Fund shall be retained solely for the purpose of paying the principal and interest on the Bonds and any Parity Obligations as to which there would otherwise be default. In the event that Parity Obligations are issued, then such payments shall be resumed until such time as there has been accumulated in the Reserve Fund an amount of money equal to the Reserve Fund Requirement.\n\n(d) The establishment and maintenance of the \ufffdElectric Utility Depreciation and Contingency Fund\ufffd (the \ufffdContingency Fund\ufffd), to care for extensions, additions, improvements, renewals and replacements necessary to operate properly the System, by transferring from the Utilities System Fund to the regularly designated fiscal agent bank of the Issuer (or such other bank designated by the Issuer), monthly in advance on or before the 20th day of each month of each year, commencing the first month following the completion of the Project, a sum equal to five percent (5%) of the amount to be paid in such month into the Sinking Fund until $200,000 is on deposit in the Contingency Fund. Should the funds in the Contingency Fund be reduced to an amount less than $200,000, said monthly payments shall recommence until a sum of $200,000 is on deposit therein, provided such sum is available after provision is made for the payments required under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above. Money in the Contingency Fund may also be used to pay the principal of and the interest on the Bonds and any Parity Obligations for the payment of which there is not sufficient money in the Sinking Fund or the Reserve Fund, but if so used, such money shall be replaced by the Issuer as soon as possible thereafter out of the earnings of the System after making the required payments into the respective funds and accounts hereinabove set out.\n\nSubject to the foregoing, which are cumulative, the balance of the excess funds on deposit in the Revenue Fund and/or the Contingency Fund may be used by the Issuer for the purpose of calling and/or paying bonds payable from the income and revenues of the System or for such other lawful corporate purposes as this Governing Authority may determine, whether or not such purposes are or are not related to the System.\n\nIf at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys in the Reserve Fund or the Contingency Fund for the purpose of paying principal of or interest on bonds payable from the Sinking Fund as to which there would otherwise be default then the moneys so used shall be replaced from the revenues first thereafter received, not hereinabove required to be used for operation and maintenance of the System or for current principal, interest and reserve requirements. If at any time there are sufficient moneys on deposit in the Reserve Fund and the Contingency Fund to retire all of the Bonds and any outstanding Parity Obligations payable from the Sinking Fund by defeasance, by exercising the redemption option provided by such bonds or by purchase on the open market, the Issuer may utilize such funds for such purpose.\n\nAll or any part of the moneys in the foregoing funds and accounts shall, at the written request of the Issuer, be invested in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the State of Louisiana. All income derived from such investments shall be added to the money in said respective funds or to the Revenue Fund, as appropriate, and such investments shall, to the extent at any time necessary, be liquidated and the proceeds thereof applied to the purpose for which the respective funds are herein created.\n\nSECTION 9. Deposit of Funds and Security Therefor. All of the income and revenues to be earned from the operation of the System shall be deposited promptly as provided in Section 8 hereof in the Revenue Fund, which Revenue Fund shall be maintained separate and apart from all other funds of the Issuer. The Sinking Fund, the Reserve Fund and the Contingency Fund shall be held by the depository banks as special trust funds for the purposes provided in this Resolution, and all other funds shall be held by the designated banks as special deposits for the purposes set forth in this Ordinance, and subject to such reasonable instructions as this Governing Authority may give in writing to the banks holding such funds. The Owners are hereby granted a lien on all funds established and/or maintained pursuant to the requirements of this Ordinance, except for the Contingency Fund, until applied in the manner herein provided. The moneys on deposit in all of the funds herein required shall at all times be secured to the full extent thereof as required by the laws of the State of Louisiana.\n\nSECTION 10. Rates and Charges. Except as provided herein, nothing in this Ordinance or in the Bonds shall be construed to prevent the Issuer from altering, amending or repealing from time to time as may be necessary any resolution or ordinance setting up and establishing a schedule or schedules of rates and charges for the services and facilities to be rendered by the System, said alterations, amendments or repeals to be conditioned upon the continued preservation of the rights of the Owners with respect to the income and revenues of the System, not alone for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds, but to give assurance and insure that the income and revenues of the System, together with such other lawfully available funds as are used by the Issuer for such purposes, shall be sufficient at all times to meet and fulfill the other provisions stated and specified in Section 8 of this Ordinance. It is understood and agreed, however, that the Issuer shall fix and maintain and collect rates and charges for the services and facilities to be rendered by the System, irrespective of the user thereof, that no free service shall be furnished to any Person, or even to the Issuer itself and that no discrimination shall be made as to rates and charges for the services and facilities of the System as between users of the same type or class.\n\nThe Issuer agrees that failure of any individual, partnership or corporation to pay said charges within fifteen (15) days of the date on which it is due shall cause such charge to become delinquent; that if such delinquent charge, with interest and penalties accrued thereon, is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date on which it became delinquent, the Issuer will shut off gas service to the affected premises, and that the Issuer and this Governing Authority and its officials, agents and employees will do all things necessary and will take advantage of all remedies afforded by law to collect and enforce the prompt payment of all charges made for services rendered by the System. All delinquent charges for such services shall on the date of delinquency have added thereto a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the charge, and the amount so due, including any penalty charge, may, in the discretion of this Governing Authority, after ten (10) days from the date of delinquency, bear interest at a reasonable rate to be established by the Governing Authority, which rate shall not be less than six per centum (6%) per annum. If services shall be discontinued as above provided, the customer shall, in addition to paying the delinquent charges, penalties and interest, if any, pay as a condition precedent to the resumption of service, a reasonable reconnection charge.\n\nIt is further understood and agreed that the schedule of rates, fees, rents and other charges being charged as of the date of the adoption of this Ordinance for services and facilities rendered by the System shall remain in effect and neither said existing schedule nor any subsequent schedule shall be reduced at any time unless all payments required for all funds by this Ordinance, including any deficiencies for prior payments, have been fully made, and unless such schedule as so reduced will in each year thereafter produce sufficient revenues to meet and fulfill the other provisions stated and specified in Section 9 of this Ordinance.\n\nSECTION 11. Right to Pledge Revenues; Rank of Lien. In providing for the issuance of the Bonds, the Issuer does hereby covenant and warrant that it is lawfully seized and possessed of the System, that it has a legal right to pledge the revenues of the System as herein provided, that the Bonds will have a lien and privilege on said revenues subject only to the prior payment from such revenues or from other lawfully available sources of all reasonable and necessary expenses of administration, operation and maintenance of the System and that the Issuer will at all times maintain the System in first class repair and working order and condition.\n\nSECTION 12. Records and Accounts; Audit Reports. As long as any of the Bonds are outstanding and unpaid in principal or interest, the Issuer shall maintain and keep proper books and accounts of the System separate and apart from all other records and accounts in which shall be made full and correct entries of all transactions relating to the System. Not later than six (6) months after the close of each fiscal year, the Issuer shall cause such an audit to be made by a recognized independent firm of certified public accountants, which audit shall reflect all receipts and disbursements of the Issuer, including those made for the account of the System. Such audit shall be available for inspection by the Owners and a copy of such audit shall be furnished to the Purchaser upon request. Each such audit, in addition to whatever matters may be thought proper by the accountant to be included therein, shall include the following:\n\n1. A statement in detail of the income and expenditures of the Sys tem for such fiscal year.\n\n2. A balance sheet as of the end of such Fiscal Year.\n\n3. The accountant\ufffds comments regarding the manner in which the Issuer has carried out the requirements of this Ordinance, and the accountant\ufffds recommendations for any changes or improve ments in the operation of the System or the method of keeping the records relating thereto.\n\n4. A list of the insurance policies in force at the end of the Fiscal Year, setting out as to each policy the amount of the policy, the risks covered, the name of the insurer and the expiration date of the policy.\n\n5. The number of metered gas customers and the number of un- metered gas customers, if any.\n\nAll expenses incurred in the making of the audits required by this Section shall be regarded and paid as a maintenance and operating expense. The Issuer further agrees that the Purchaser, the Paying Agent and any Owner shall have the right to discuss with the accountant making the audit the contents of the audit and to ask for such additional information as they may reasonably require. The Issuer further agrees that the Purchaser, the Paying Agent, and the Owners shall have at all reasonable times the right to inspect the System and the records, accounts and data of the Issuer relating thereto.\n\nSECTION 13. Rights of Owners; Appointment of Receiver in Event of Default. The Owners from time to time shall be entitled to exercise all rights and powers for which provision is made in the laws of the State of Louisiana. Any Owner or any trustee acting for such Owners in the manner hereinafter provided, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Louisiana, or granted and contained in this Ordinance, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this Ordinance, or by any applicable statutes to be performed by the Issuer or by any agency, board or officer thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of rentals, fees or other charges for the use of the System, and in general to take any action necessary to most effectively protect the rights of the Owners.\n\nIn the event that default shall be made in the payment of the interest on or the principal of any of the Bonds as the same shall become due, or in the making of the payments into any Sinking Fund or Reserve Fund or any other payments required to be made by this Ordinance, or in the event that the Issuer or any agency, board, officer, agent or employee thereof shall fail or refuse to comply with the provisions of this Ordinance or shall default in any covenant made herein, and in the further event that any such default shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice, any Owner of such Bonds or any trustee appointed to represent the Owners as hereinafter provided, shall be entitled as of right to the appointment of a receiver of the System in an appropriate judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nThe receiver so appointed shall forthwith directly or by his agents and attorneys, enter into and upon and take possession of the System, and each and every part thereof, and shall hold, operate and maintain, manage and control the System, and each and every part thereof, and in the name of the Issuer shall exercise all the rights and powers of the Issuer with respect to the System as the Issuer itself might do. Such receiver shall collect and receive all rates, fees, rentals and other revenues, maintain and operate the System in the manner provided in this Ordinance, and comply under the jurisdiction of the court appointing such receiver, with all of the provisions of this Ordinance.\n\nWhenever all that is due upon the Bonds and interest thereon, and under any covenants of this Ordinance for reserve, sinking or other funds, and upon any other obligations and interest thereon, having a charge, lien or encumbrance upon the fees, rentals or other revenues of the System, shall have been paid and made good, and all defaults under the provisions of this Ordinance shall have been cured and made good, possession of the System shall be surrendered to the Issuer upon the entry of an order of the court to that effect. Upon any subsequent default, any Owner, or any trustee appointed for Owners as hereinafter provided, shall have the same right to secure the further appointment of a receiver upon any such subsequent default.\n\nSuch receiver shall in the performance of the powers hereinabove conferred upon him be under the direction and supervision of the court making such appointment, shall at all times be subject to the orders and decrees of such court, and may be removed thereby and a successor receiver appointed in the discretion of such court. Nothing herein contained shall limit or restrict the jurisdiction of such court to enter such other and further orders and decrees as such court may deem necessary or appropriate for the exercise by the receiver of any function not specifically set forth herein.\n\nAny receiver appointed as provided herein shall hold and operate the System in the name of the Issuer and for the joint protection and benefit of the Issuer and the Owners. Such receiver shall have no power to sell, assign, mortgage or otherwise dispose of any property of any kind or character belonging or pertaining to the System but the authority of such receiver shall be limited to the possession, operation and maintenance of the System for the sole purpose of the protection of both the Issuer and the Owners and the curing and making good of any default under the provisions of this Ordinance, and the title to and the ownership of the System shall remain in the Issuer, and no court shall have any jurisdiction to enter any order or decree permitting or requiring such receiver to sell, mortgage or otherwise dispose of any property of the System except with the consent of the Issuer and in such manner as the court shall direct.\n\nThe Owner or Owners in an aggregate principal amount of not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Bonds then outstanding may by a duly executed certificate appoint a trustee for the Owners with authority to represent such Owners in any legal proceedings for the enforcement and protection of the rights of such Owners. Such certificate shall be executed by such Owners, or by their duly authorized attorneys or representatives, and shall be filed in the office of the Clerk of the Issuer.\n\nUntil an event of default shall have occurred, the Issuer shall retain full possession and control of the System with full right to manage, operate and use the same and every part thereof with the rights appertaining thereto, and to collect and receive, and, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, to take, use and enjoy and distribute the earnings, income, rent, issue and profits accruing on or derivable from the System.\n\nSECTION 14. Maintenance of System, Limitations on Sale, Lease or Other Disposition of Property. So long as any of the Bonds are outstanding and unpaid in principal or interest, the Issuer shall be bound and obligated at all times to (i) maintain the System in first class repair and working order and condition and (ii) not sell, lease, encumber or in any manner dispose of the System or any substantial part thereof; provided, however, that this covenant shall not be construed to prevent the disposal by the Issuer of property which in its judgement has become worn out, unserviceable, unsuitable or unnecessary in the operation of the System, when other property of equal value is substituted therefor or the sale price thereof is deposited in the Contingency Fund.\n\nSECTION 15. Competitive Franchises. So long as any of the Bonds are outstanding and unpaid in principal and interest, the Issuer obligates itself not to grant a franchise to any utility for operation within the boundaries of the Issuer which would render services or facilities similar to those of the System and also obligates itself to oppose the granting of any such franchise by any other public board having jurisdiction over such matters. Further, the Issuer shall maintain its corporate identity and existence as long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding.\n\nSECTION 16. Prohibition Against Encumbrances. Except as hereinafter provided in Section 17 hereof, the Issuer hereby covenants that it will not voluntarily create or cause to be created any debt, lien, pledge, mortgage, assignment, encumbrance or any other charge whatsoever having priority over or a parity with the lien of the Bonds and the interest thereon upon any of the Revenues pledged as security therefor in this Ordinance.\n\nSECTION 17. Issuance of Parity Obligations; Parity Requirements. The Bonds shall enjoy complete parity of lien on the net revenues of the System despite the fact that any of the Bonds may be delivered at an earlier date than any other of the Bonds. The Issuer hereby covenants that it shall issue no other bonds or obligations of any kind or nature payable from or enjoying a lien on the\nrevenues of the System having priority over or parity with the Bonds, except that Parity Obligations may be issued hereafter if the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The Bonds or any part thereof may be refunded and the refund ing bonds so issued shall enjoy complete equality of lien with the portion of the Bonds which is not refunded, if there be any, and the refunding bonds shall continue to enjoy whatever priority of lien over subsequent issues as may have been enjoyed by the Bonds refunded, provided, however, that if only a portion of the Bonds outstanding is so refunded and if the refunding bonds re quire total principal and interest payments during any year in ex cess of the principal and interest which would have been re quired in such year to pay the Bonds refunded thereby, then such Bonds may not be refunded without the consent of the Owners of the unrefunded portion of the Bonds issued hereun der; or\n\n2. Parity Obligations may also be issued on a parity with the Bonds if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) The net revenues for (a) any consecutive twelve (12) cal endar months in the eighteen (18) month period immediately pre ceding the date of issuance of the proposed Parity Obligations or (b) the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of issuance of such Parity Obligations, adjusted to reflect any increase in rates which has been adopted by this Governing Authority and which will take effect prior to a date not later than the date of the deliv ery of such Parity Obligations, are equal to at least 120% of the average annual debt service requirements on all bonds or obliga tions whatsoever then outstanding which are payable from the revenues of the System, and any Parity Obligations theretofore issued and then outstanding (but not including bonds which have been refunded or provision otherwise made for their full and complete payment and redemption), and the Parity Obligations so proposed to be issued; provided, however, that this limitation may be waived or modified by the written consent of the owners of the Bonds then outstanding. (Junior and subordinate bonds may be issued without restriction). In making the calculation set out in this paragraph it will not be necessary to include in any cal culation future interest payments to be paid from capitalized in terest.\n\n(b) The payments required to be made into the various funds provided in Section 8 hereof must be current.\n\n(c) The existence of the facts required by paragraphs (a) and (b) above must be determined by the chief financial officer of the Issuer.\n\n(d) The proceeds of the additional bonds must be used solely for the making of improvements, extensions, renewals, re placements or repairs to the System or to refund the Bonds or any Parity Obligations.\n\nSECTION 18. Fidelity Bonds. So long as any of the Bonds are outstanding and unpaid, the Issuer, in operating the System, shall require all of its officers and employees who may be in a position of authority or in possession of money derived from the operation of the System, to obtain or be covered by a blanket fidelity or faithful performance bond, or independent fidelity bonds written by a responsible indemnity company in amounts adequate to protect the Issuer from loss.\n\nSECTION 19. Retention and Duties of Consulting Engineer in Event of Failure to Make Required Payments. The Issuer covenants and agrees that in the event it should fail to derive sufficient income from the operation of the System to make the required monthly payments into the funds established by Section 9 hereby, it will retain a Consulting Engineer (the \ufffdEngineer\ufffd) on a continuous basis until all defaults are cured, for the purpose of providing for the Issuer continuous engineering counsel in the operation of its System. Such Engineer shall be retained under contract at such reasonable compensation as may be fixed by this Governing Authority, and the payment of such compensation shall be considered to be one of the costs of maintaining and operating the System. Any Engineer appointed under the provisions of this Section may be replaced at any time by another Engineer appointed or retained by the Issuer, with the consent and approval of the original Purchaser of the Bonds.\n\nThe Engineer shall prepare within ninety (90) days after the close of each Fiscal Year a comprehensive operating report, which report shall contain therein or be accompanied by a certified copy of an audit of the preceding Fiscal Year prepared by the Issuer's certified public accountants, and in addition thereto, shall report upon the operations of the System during the preceding Fiscal Year, the maintenance of the properties, the efficiency of the management of the System, the proper and adequate keeping of books of record and account, the adherence to budget and budgetary control provisions, the adherence to the provisions of this Ordinance and all other things having a bearing upon the efficient and profitable operation of the System, and shall include whatever criticism of any phase of the operation of the System the Engineer may deem proper, and such recommendations as to changes in operations and the making of repairs, renewals, replacements, extensions, betterments and improvements as the Engineer may deem proper. Copies of such report shall be placed on file with the Clerk of the Issuer and sent to the Purchaser, and shall be open to inspection by any Owners of any of the Bonds. It shall be the duty of the Engineer to pass on the economic soundness or feasibility of any extensions, betterments, improvements, expenditures or purchases of equipment and materials or supplies, which will involve the expenditure of more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), whether in one or more than one order, and whether authorized by a budget or not, from funds on deposit in the Contingency Fund, and the Engineer shall devise and prescribe a form or forms wherein shall be set forth his or its approval in certificate form, copies of which shall be filed with the Clerk of the Issuer and the depository for the Contingency Fund.\n\nSixty (60) days before the close of each Fiscal Year, the Engineer shall submit to this Governing Authority a suggested budget for the ensuing year's operation of the System and shall submit recommendations as to the schedule of rates and charges for services supplied by the System, taking into account any other lawfully available funds of the Issuer that may be available for such purposes. A copy of said suggested budget and recommendations shall also be furnished by said Engineer directly to the Purchaser. Such recommendations as to rates and charges, consistent with the requirements relating thereto contained herein, shall be followed by this Governing Authority insofar as practicable and all other recommendations shall be given careful consideration by this Governing Authority and shall be substantially followed, except for good and reasonable cause. No expenditures for the operation, maintenance and repair of the System in excess of the amounts stated in said budget shall be made in any year, except upon the certificate of the Engineer that such expenditures are necessary and essential to the continued operation of the System.\n\nIt shall be the duty of the Engineer to prescribe a system of budgetary control along with forms for exercising of such control which shall be utilized by the manager or superintendent of the System and his staff, and the manager or superintendent shall cause to be prepared monthly reports not later than the twentieth day of each month, for the preceding month's business and operation of the System, which reports shall be submitted to the Engineer, who shall prepare an analysis of each such report, which analysis shall be filed monthly as expeditiously as possible with the chief financial officer of the Issuer and with the Owner(s).\n\nIn the event this Governing Authority shall fail to select and retain an Engineer in accordance with the first paragraph hereof within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the conditions prescribed thereby, then upon the petition of the Owners of twenty-five percent (25%) of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding, this Governing Authority shall select and retain such Engineer as is named in the petition of said Owners.\n\nThe provisions of this Section shall apply only during any period when the Issuer may be in default in making required payments into the funds required by Section 9 of this Ordinance.\n\nSECTION 20. Recital of Regularity. This Governing Authority having investigated the regularity of the proceedings had in connection with the Bonds herein authorized and having determined the same to be regular, the Bonds shall contain the following recital, to-wit:\n\n\ufffdIt is certified that this Bond is authorized by and is issued in conformity with\nthe requirements of the Constitution and statutes of the State of Louisiana.\ufffd\n\nSECTION 21. Ordinance a Contract; Amendment. The provisions of this Ordinance shall constitute a contract between the Issuer and any Owner or Owners, and any such Owner or Owners may at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, enforce and compel the performance of all duties required to be performed by this Governing Authority as a result of issuing the Bonds.\n\nNo material modification or amendment of this Ordinance, or of any ordinance amendatory hereof or supplemental hereto, may be made without the consent in writing of the Owners of two-thirds (2/3) of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding; provided, however, that no such modification or amendment shall permit a change in the maturity or the redemption provisions of the Bonds, or a reduction in the rate of interest thereon, or in the amount of the principal obligation thereof, or affecting the obligation of the Issuer to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds as the same shall become due from the revenues of the System, or change the requirements specified herein for the issuance of Parity Obligations under the provisions of this Ordinance, or reduce the percentage of the Owners required to consent to any material modification or amendment of this Ordinance, without the consent of such Owner or Owners.\n\nSECTION 22.

Smith, whose address is 500 E. Reynolds Drive, Ruston, LA 71270, has been appointed liquidator. All creditors of the Company should submit claims to the liquidator at the above referenced address immediately describing the name of the creditor and the nature and amount of the claim. A claim against the dissolved Company will be extinguished by preemption unless a proceeding to enforce the claim is commenced within three years of the publication of this notice under Louisiana Revised Statutes 12:1-1407 (subject to earlier preemption pursuant to Louisiana Revised Statutes 12:1-1406(c), if applicable, and subject to sooner prescription by operation of law).\n1tdJanuary 14,2020\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fellowship Water System is currently in violation of the treatment technique requirements for minimum residual disinfectant level as set forth by the State (Part XII of the Louisiana State Sanitary Code). Although this incident is not an emergency, as our customers, you have a right to know what happened and what we are doing to correct this situation.\nThe Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) has determined that the presence of microbiological contaminants is a health concern at certain levels of exposure and requires the disinfection of drinking water to kill disease-causing organisms. Inadequately treated water may contain disease-causing organisms. These organisms include bacteria, viruses, and parasites which can cause symptoms such as nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and associated headaches. These symptoms, however, are not just associated with disease-causing organisms in drinking water, but also may be caused by a number of factors other than your drinking water. LDH has set enforceable requirements for treating drinking water to reduce the risk of these adverse health effects. Treatment such as filtering and disinfecting the water removes and destroys microbiological contaminants. Drinking water which is treated to meet LDH requirements is associated with little to none of this risk and should be considered safe.\nWe are required to monitor your water for the residual disinfectant level. This tells us whether we are effectively treating the water supply. During the compliance monitoring periods of (November 1, 2019 through November 30, 2019), and (December 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019), the Fellowship Water System failed to provide the minimum residual disinfectant level in the treated water supplied to customers. The violation occurred because the treated water chlorine residual was less than 0.5 milligrams per liter in over five percent of the samples collected in the water system in two consecutive months.\nYou do not need to boil your water or take other corrective actions. However, if you have specific health concerns, consult your doctor.\nPlease share this information with all the other people who drink this water, especially those who may not have received this notice directly (for example, people in apartments, nursing homes, schools, and businesses). You can do this by posting this notice in a public place or distributing copies by hand or mail.\nFellowship Water System uses chlorine ejectors to put the chlorine in the water wells. During the month of November 2019, one of our chlorine ejectors broke down. Fellowship Water System has replaced one of the chlorine ejectors with an updated version, and has made repairs to the other. We will continue to work to maintain a safe level of chlorine in our water.\nFor more information, please contact Fellowship Water System at 318-247-1610.\nThis notice is being sent to you by Fellowship Water System\nPWS ID # LA1061004\nJanuary 10, 2020\n1td January 14, 2020\n\n\n\n\nPARISH OF LINCOLN\nPUBLIC NOTICE\nParcel# 35183139099\nNotice is hereby given that the Parish of Lincoln has received a request to sell their respective tax interest in the following listed properties.

He stated that living in a depressed area and a low income poverty area he was concerned with the increasing amounts. He stated with a top of the line water system we continue to have water which is not drinkable or cannot cook with either. He stated that something must be done as this is not acceptable. He stated that most of the residents are still buying water to both drink and cook, especially since they received notices of water problems so often. He stated if it can?t be worked out here then it needs to go to the next step which he believes is the court system.\nEran Robinson: Representative of JPC Management, Inc. asked if he could address Mr. Turners? concerns. He stated that the State assigned administrator set the rates based on the cost of operations. The water can be used and can be used for drinking and cooking. The TTHM?s in the water is an issue in most water system and this will not affect anybody in this lifetime. He explained the rate structure and stated that St. Joe water is clean water.\nAlderman Jackson stated that with the ?cancer? reference even Long Term is enough to scare the public in not drinking the water. Cancer is too relevant and wide spread in this area.\nEran Robinson, stated that they are working on the elimination of the TTHM?s. He reported that an aerator has been placed in the tower and testing will begin to see if this works. If not then they will go to Plan B to try to eliminate the issue.\nHe reported that 453 meters were active last month and this month 450 active meters. He also stated that each of the six lift stations require two pumps but only 1 in each station is operating. Water loss is less than 5% currently. He stated that he will be giving the Mayor a Pay Star application where people can pay on line. He further stated he will take calls from anyone who has an issue and he will try to resolve the issue. He stated again that the water is safe to drink and cook.\nMark Guy: Drainage complaint- Mr. Jackson advised that an engineer is needed to address the entire town drainage issue. Eliminating one issue will only create issues for another.\nNew Business:\nDOTD Proposal Road Transfer Program ? Joy Sims, Healthy Community representative. State trying to give roads back to parish and cities. Cities will receive credits to be used for whatever roads repairs needed. This will only happen if the Parish and City approve and accept the proposal.\nMs. Simms advised she will have a Vision Session for future planning to be held on February 27, 2020.\nKeith Smith ? Addressed the board about his desire and Mr. Wilbur Blackman?s desire to providing housing in the St. Joseph area. He stated he was told his cost to have a tap placed on the property would be approximately $700.00. He thinks this is a tad much and he wants to propose to the town that he pay of the cost and town pay . He sees this as helping the town by providing decent housing for potential residents.

She had recently retired from the City after 39 years of service. Mayor Piazza read the certificate of appreciation aloud.\n\n-01 introduced by Mr. Francis Touchet, Jr. and seconded by Ms. Roslyn White to approve the minutes from the November 19, 2019 regular City Council meeting.

East Street since the bid was so high ($4,500) and to revisit the issue at a later date once other options are researched. The motion carried unanimously.\n\nChief Mire discussed the recent fire rating results. In the state of Louisiana there are 600 different cities and districts that are rated. There are 9 of them that have a rating of 1, 35 that are rated at 2 and the City of Abbeville received a rating of 3. This is the same rating that we have been for several years. In 2014 our score was 74 out of a scale of 105. You get points based on communication, trucks, training and other things. All these points add up and that is shown on the report that was distributed to you tonight. In 2019 our score was 78.3. We are very close to a 2. We will meet in January with the gentleman that rated us. He will point out to us what we were deficient in and what we can improve on. The big thing that the Chief is trying to work out with the parish is to get the training\ncenter. If we had a training center, we would have received an additional 3 points so we may have been a 2 rating. That would have put us in the top 40 departments in the state of Louisiana. We are rated every 5 years. Mayor Piazza stated it is important to mention, since a lot of people don?t understand the significance of the fire rating, that this directly affects your homeowner?s premiums for homeowner insurance. It also affects your business insurance for your fire premiums. The lower the rating, the lower your premiums will be for 5 years. Since we are at a 3 and we have been at a 3, our insurance premiums for fire protection will not go up.\n\n-05 introduced by Mr. Francis Plaisance and seconded by Ms. Terry Broussard to adopt a sexual harassment policy in keeping with Act 270 of the regular session of the 2018 Legislature. The motion carried unanimously.\n\n-06 introduced by Mr. Francis Touchet, Jr. and seconded by Ms. Roslyn White to approve pay application #15 in the amount of $46,738.71 payable to Minvielle Lumber for retainage and a portion of the punch list and the invoice from The Sellers Group, both for the Airport Terminal Building Renovation project. The motion carried unanimously.\n\nCouncilman Touchet asked for an update on the chicken issue on South St. Valerie. He asked Mr. Funderburk to provide the update. Mr. Funderburk stated we asked the Chief of Police to take pictures. He did and Mr. Funderburk has the pictures. Mr. Funderburk met with Mr. Thibodeaux and Mr. Thibodeaux indicated that he would make another effort to get videos. Be that as it may, this thing has lingered on for a long time. He referred to section 4.1 in the ordinances, definitions. A person who has possession of the chicken must keep control of the chicken with a secure fence. One of the properties has no fencing at all. The other property has fencing that is inadequate to hold the chickens. Ike will file criminal charges against the property owners. Ike stated we have already sent letters. Mayor Piazza stated that it will take something more forceful than a letter from the tax department. Ike stated we will have Mr. Thibodeaux testify in court and we will present the documents filed by the tax and permit department and we will present the picture as evidence. We will file criminal charges at City court and they will be summoned to come to court by subpoena. We will have a warrant out for their arrest.\n\nClay Menard, Public Works Director\nCouncilman Plaisance asked about the hole on Rodeo Road left by the sewer project contractor. Clay stated the contractor cannot fix the issue permanently until is settles. They dug down 10 feet so it will take a long time to settle and compact. We continue to add limestone and dress it up as it settles. Once it settles completely, the contractor will make the permanent repair. That is part of the LCDBG and it is part of the contractor?s punch list. If we could get some more rain, it would help to compact it.\nCouncilwoman Broussard asked Clay to meet with here in front of Pleasant Green Church to discuss holes in front of the church. She also wanted to meet with him to discuss the Martin Luther King Street project.\n\nMayor Mark Piazza\nHe appreciates the support of the Council not only for himself but for the Police Chief and for all the City employees. This is been a very trying year and trying experience for all of us. Nobody likes taxes. Our employees are the beneficiaries of a nice salary increase as well as himself and the Police Chief. We will see the results in long-term with better quality personnel and the ability to hire better personnel. It will provide a better work environment and we will see productivity increase out there. This will improve the morale of the employees and it will be a different situation than what we are having now. These were not easy decisions to make. He?s a business owner he knows what it?s like. In the long run, the City will be much better off due to the efforts we made this year. We have made tougher decisions this year than we have had to make in the past five years. He thanked the new City Councilwomen for their research and their homework to make these decisions. They did not take these decisions lightly.\n\nBill Spearman, Chief of Police\nHe thanked all the Council members for his raise. The officers are looking forward to their raise and it is well deserved.\n\nJude Mire, Fire Chief\nThanked the Mayor and Council for their support.\n\nCouncilman Francis Plaisance\nThe Christmas parade will be Saturday night at 6:00 PM.\n\nCouncilwoman Terry Broussard\nShe will be having her first Christmas event for underprivileged children on Friday.

It would be appropriate at this time for anyone in the audience to make comments pertaining to this issue. There were none. Mayor Piazza stated that we went through the budget in great detail at the last Finance Committee meeting held on December 3, 2019. The budget was presented by Mr. Steve Moosa. We are presenting a very good balanced budget with a small surplus. It will be work in progress as budgets are a guideline. Overtime will have to monitored.

Gertrude, 1728 Franks Alley and 309 9th Street.\n\n1507 Franks Alley ? represented by Ricky LaFleur, attorney. Mr. LaFleur stated he is the appointed representative of the estate of Beatrice Bruno. She is the record owner of the property. He was appointed by Mr. Funderburk because the succession has not yet been opened. His duty is to try to find the family of Ms. Beatrice Bruno to let them know this is going on. He is trying to locate the son. He has spoken to the property owners around the property but they do not know where he is. Mr. Funderburk stated this was all done so we could file suit since there was no representative that we could serve. The property was inspected by Clay Menard on November 27, 2019. It was found that the cost to repair the structure to current code outweighs the cost to demolish the property, therefore, the property should be condemned and demolished. He recommended that the Council proceed with the condemnation of the property.\n\n-05 introduced by Ms. Roslyn White and seconded by Ms. Terry Broussard to condemn the structure located at 1507 Franks Alley and proceed with the demotion process. The motion carried unanimously.\n\n207 S. Gertrude ? no representative. Mr. Funderburk stated that the inspection was completed by Mr. Menard on December 4, 2019. He went to the site and found the cost to repair the structure to current code outweighs the cost to demolish the property, therefore the property should be condemned and demolished. Councilwoman Broussard stated that Ms. Adams had purchased the permit to demolish the property but it expired after 90 days and nothing was done. She would like to make contact with Ms. Adams and get back with the tax department.\n\n-06 introduced by Ms. Terry Broussard and seconded by Ms. Roslyn White to condemn the structure located at 207 S. Gertrude but allow Councilwoman Broussard an opportunity to meet and negotiate with the property owner and report back to the tax department before the demolition process begins. The motion carried unanimously.\n\n1728 Franks Alley ? represented by Kimberly Bolden. Mr. Funderburk stated that Mr. Menard completed the inspection of the property on November 27, 2019 and found the cost to repair the structure to current code outweighed the cost to demolish, therefore it should be condemned and demolished. Ms. Bolden would like to repair the property. She has small children and would like to pass something on to them. She had someone living in the property but they moved out in January 2019. She lives in Lafayette and right now she is dealing with her children (twins) that have health issues. This is more important than this property so she comes here very seldom. She has boarded up the property but when she does come down here, the boards have been removed. She has to pay someone to put the boards back up which takes money out of her kids? mouths. She thinks this is being done intentionally because the neighbors want to buy her property. She has all this documented on her phone. Councilwoman Broussard asked Ms. Bolden how long would it take to repair the property and will when the work begin. Ms. Bolden stated the only thing that needs to be repaired is the back section of the roof. It has a leak. Sheetrock will also have to be repaired because of the leak. This is not major and she does not understand why it was deemed unlivable. She could go right now, change the door locks, change the floor which has rotted away because of the roof leaking and repair the sheetrock and it could be lived in. It has been leaking like this for over a year. She will start on this once she is finish dealing with her babies. Councilwoman Broussard stated that as long as those complaints continue, the letters won?t stop and sooner or later the City will be forced to take action. Councilwoman Broussard wanted to grant the property owner until March (90 days) to bring this property into compliance. Ms. Bolden stated that she is having surgery in March. Councilwoman Broussard stated then we will give until February. Ms. Bolden stated the only thing she can do is board it up. This has been going on. Councilwoman Broussard agreed that this has been going on a long time but nothing has been done. Mayor Piazza asked if Ms. Bolden owns the lot too. Mr. Menard stated he inspected the property but could only see through the windows. There is some structural damage from the roof leaking over a period of time. The floors are gone and the doors were open as far as he could tell. There were some parts of the house he could not see. There are some supports that are rotten and it will cost a good bit of money to get the house repaired from what he could see. Ms. Bolden offered to accompany Mr. Menard on a walk through of the property. Councilwoman White asked if we received responses from the certified letters that were sent. Mayor Piazza answered yes. Councilwoman Broussard asked Ms. Bolden when she will be able to make repairs to the property so that the City won?t have to continue contacting her because the windows are broken or the doors are being kicked in. This is what happens to homes that are not being occupied. This is what happens in today?s world. She needs to know this from Ms. Bolden because, right now, she is leaning towards March. We could work with you up until March to get the repairs done and she cannot give anymore time. This issue has been going on a very long time. Ms. Bolden stated she cannot get anything done by March. Mayor Piazza asked Ms. Bolden how long would it take her to get the roof repaired and the doors and windows secured. Ms. Bolden stated she could do the doors and windows now. Mayor Piazza stated the roof needs to be repaired too because just securing the doors and windows will not do any good if the roof is not repaired. We do not want vandalism in there and people going in and out of there. This structure was brought before the Council because we received complaints from the neighbors. Ms. Bolden stated that they will continue to receive complaints from the neighbors because that is who wants to buy the property. Mayor Piazza stated the grass was not cut all summer long and we had to send someone twice this summer to cut the grass. Ms. Bolden stated the City can do what they want and she will hire an attorney. She hired Darrell Thibodeaux to cut the grass. The grass did get tall but whoever is telling you they are cutting the grass is not telling the truth because Darrell Thibodeaux has been cutting the grass. Mayor Piazza asked Ms. Bolden, again, how long would it take her to complete the repairs. Ms. Bolden stated she would like until the end of April 2020. She does not have time to be dealing with this right now because she has more important thing to deal with. Councilwoman White asked Mr. Funderburk about our ordinance dealing with tarps on the roof. Mr. Funderburk stated a tarp is an approved device for an interim but it is not a final repair. That is according to State building codes.\n\n-07 introduced by Ms. Terry Broussard to condemn the structure located at 1728 Franks Alley and to give the property owner until April 15, 2020 to make the repairs. If the repairs are not made by then the City will begin the demolition process. The motion died for lack of a second.\n\n-08 introduced by Ms. Roslyn White and seconded by Mr. Francis Plaisance to condemn the structure located at 1728 Franks Alley and to move forward with the demolition process. The motion was put to a vote and the vote thereon was as follows:\nYEAS:3(Plaisance, B. Broussard, White)\nNAYS:1(T. Broussard)\nABSENT:1(Touchet)\nABSTAIN:0\nTherefore, the motion carried.\n\n309 9th Street ? represented by Robert Kelly, Sandra Cain and Shirley Grogan. Mr. Kelly stated he lives in Texas and has been getting these letters. Two years ago, he came here and paid the taxes and he noticed they had a raggedy mobile home on the property. He went to his cousin and asked her about the mobile home and who had given permission to place that on the property. We do not know anything about that. When he got home, he contacted the tax office and brought it to their attention. He did not give permission for a mobile home to be moved onto the property. We had problems before when his nephew wanted to but a trailer there and she (Shirley Grogan) would not allow him to put it there but she did allow this gentleman?s girlfriend to put that mobile home there. That thing is not livable and it is not worth fixing. It needs to be removed from the property. If they tear it down, then they will leave all the trash on the property and then we will be bothered again. I came today because of the certified letter he received from the tax office. He is part owner of the property. Only one person takes it into her own hands to tell people what they can do with the property. That is not right because we have to pay taxes too. We inherited this from our grandmother through our parents. When his father died, we inherited his part. She needs to consult all of us in order to do something on that property. The trailer needs to be gone. He will only accept demolition is if the City does it. They will not do it. Mayor Piazza asked if the family wants to evict him off of the property. Mr. Kelly stated he has no business putting the trailer there. He is not family. Councilwoman Broussard asked if the family is giving permission to go on the property and demolish the mobile home. Mr. Kelly stated yes but he is not paying any money. Councilwoman Broussard wanted the family to understand that the cost of demolition has to be put against the property as a lien. Mr. Kelly again stated that he is not paying anything. He would agree to the mobile home being removed and hauled off by the owner. They need to pay for that because they put it there. Ms. Sandra Cain stated that the people who put the trailer should have to tear the trailer down because she will not pay for something that she did not put there. Let them do it. Mr. Funderburk stated that on co-owned property, everybody has the same rights as everybody else. So, if I am a co-owner of property, I can possess the entirety of the property to the exclusion of everyone else if they acquiesce. That is obviously what we have in this situation. The trailer doesn?t belong to the landowners but unfortunately, it is the land that is going to wind up being liened for the cost of the demolition of the trailer unless the owner of the trailer does what he should have done a long time ago which is removing the trailer from the property. This would solve the problem for the landowner. Ms. Shirley Grogan stated that she gave permission to put the trailer there. She (the girlfriend of the gentleman) said she was going to have the trailer redone but she did not. I have been telling her to get it off the property. My mother was the owner and she passed away so I am the owner. It is dangerous to have that on the property. People can go in there and hide and we do not want that. She is not for trouble. She wants it torn down or removed. She asked if she could have until January 31, 2020 to have the trailer removed off of the property. Councilwoman Broussard stated she was willing to give until January 31, 2020 and she remined Ms. Grogan that they will have to come into the tax office and get a demolition permit. They are responsible for hauling what they tear down to the solid waste facility. They are responsible for the total cleanup. If the City has to come in because it is not done, there will be a lien on the property.\n\n-09 introduced by Ms. Terry Broussard and seconded by Mr. Brady Broussard, Jr. to condemn the structure located at 309 9th Street and grant the property owners until January 31, 2020 to remove or demolish the structure or the City will begin the demolition process.

So, he thanks this Council for focusing on blight. He thanks Sarah and Theresa in the tax department. We will fight this head on. If someone comes to the Council meeting, we do want to talk to them.

We have three items on the agenda all\npertaining to the budget ordinance. He asked if there were any public comments on any agenda item. There were none so he turned the floor over to Councilman Touchet, the Finance Committee Chairman.\n\nCouncilman Touchet stated that the first item was the presentation of the budget for 2020 and the amendments to the budget for 2019. He turned the floor over to Mr. Steve Moosa to share that information with us. Mr. Moosa discussed the 2020 budget and the amendment to the 2019 budget. In this budget we have the line by line budget for the General fund and for the Sales tax funds as required by state law. The budget does account for the required principle and interest payments on the debt service. The City is in good shape as far as the debt. We have 150 employees with the City. This includes all full-time and part-time employees. The budget also includes the pay increases for all City employees from the new sales tax. Councilwoman White asked about the pay raises for the City Court employees. Councilman Broussard stated these raises are not part of the raises dealing with the sales tax. Mr. Moosa stated the general fund revenues are $1.865 million and the special funds revenue are $5.1 million. A budget for the Utility system fund is not required by state law. The expenditures for the general fund are $10.5 million and expenditures for the special revenue funds are $989,000. We support the general fund by transfers in from the utility system fund. Mr. Moosa stated at the next city Council meeting you will approve the budget for the next fiscal year. This is a good balanced budget. Mayor Piazza highlighted two items on page 11 dealing with sales tax. We have budgeted money for the website as requested by Councilwoman White. On page 12 we have budgeted the City?s match for the streetscape project. That project will be beginning January 6, 2020. He also discussed Capital outlay expenditures. These expenditures include the completion of the splash pad, the Lafitte walking trail and the renovation to the tennis courts.\n\nCouncilman Touchet stated the next item is to review and recommend for adoption an ordinance amending Chapter 2, sections 2.1 and 2.21. He asked Mr. Ike Funderburk to explain the proposed ordinance. Mr. Funderburk stated the Mayor and the Chief of Police have their salary fixed by ordinance. The current salary for the Mayor is $67,000 per year and for the Chief of Police it is $55,520 per year. He was asked to draft an amendment to those ordinances. He left the dollar amounts blank so there could be discussion as to any salary modifications that need to be made. If there any changes, it would go into effect at some point during the month of January 2020. Councilwoman White stated that she did some research to find out when the Chief and the Mayor had received their last pay raise. The last time the Mayor received a salary increase was in 2010 and the last time the Chief received a pay raise was 2012. She ran some calculations based on a 2% cost-of-living increase like our regular employees receive. She took the Mayor?s current salary and added a 2% increase. She also did this with a 1.5% increase and a 1% increase. This would give us a starting point to calculate from. With a 2% increase the Mayor?s salary in 2019 would be $80,071.20. With a 1.5% increase his salary would be $76,607.13. With a 1% increase his salary would be $73,276.91. The Chief?s base salary in 2019 would be $63,775.03 with a 2% increase. The annual salary would be $69,775.03 including his $6,000 supplemental pay. With a 1.5% increase his base salary would be $61,618.59. His total annual salary would be $67,618.59 with the $6,000 supplemental pay. If we calculated with a 1% increase the base salary would be $59,524.95. This would compute to an annual salary of $65,524.95 when the $6,000 supplemental pay is added in. She would like to see the Mayor making about $77,000 per year and the Chief would be at about $65,000 per year plus is $6000 supplemental pay for a total annual salary of $71,000. These increases would put the Mayor a little bit above 1.5% and the Chief above the 2% mark. Councilman Broussard stated he likes the research and homework that Councilwoman White did. He is not sure that the pay rate proposed by Councilwoman White would satisfy what the Mayor does for this City and for the hundreds that rely on him in this City. He is a tremendous value to the City of Abbeville. Councilman Touchet stated that the Mayor would be making less than the people that he supervises. He would like to see the Mayor making somewhere between the 1.5% and 2%. He is proposing an annual salary for the mayor of $79,000. We will be moving the Chief up too but he also gets the benefit of the state supplemental pay of $6,000 per year. He feels like the Chief?s salary should be set at $65,000 per year. Councilwoman Broussard thanked Councilwoman White for her numbers. She is comfortable with the numbers Councilman Touchet proposed. She cannot see an employee making more than the Mayor. Councilman Plaisance also wanted to add that the increase for the Mayor and the Police Chief is not associated with the new sales tax. The money will be coming from the general fund budget. Mr. Gene Sellers stated that he?s been serving this City for 60 years and he works closely with the Mayor and the Mayor?s pay should be above any City employee. Mr. Joseph Vallee? stated he is okay with the increase too. He has been a great Mayor for all of these years. Mayor Piazza stated he appreciates anything and wherever the numbers fall he will be okay and very grateful. He is satisfied with whatever they feel his salary should be.\n\n-01 introduced by Mr. Francis Touchet, Jr. and seconded by Ms. Terry Broussard to recommend an ordinance for adoption to the City Council at their meeting scheduled for December 17, 2019, amending Chapter 2, Sections 2.1 and 2.21 whereby setting the annual salary for the Mayor at $79,000 per year and for the Chief of Police at $65,000 per year to be paid from the General Fund budget. The motion carried unanimously.\n\n-02 introduced by Ms. Roslyn White and seconded by Ms. Terry Broussard to recommend to the City Council to adopt an ordinance at the December 17, 2019 meeting, to adopt the 2020 budget, including the recent recommendations for amendments to Chapter 2 pertaining to the Mayor and Police Chief?s salary, and amending the 2019 budget.

In response, to Police Juror Myron Matherne stating that the bayou is there and can be used, Chief Breaux stated that the level of the water is up and down and reaching the bayou can be difficult. Police Juror Leroy Blanchard stated that a permanent dry hydrant can be installed at the location that would reach into the bayou and be adequate. He then stated that in his opinion, this isn?t a fire protection issue because of the water source that is in the location. Chief Breaux insisted that this is not a direct water source due to the trees and the water level. He then stated that the main concern is that the Parish has an ordinance that states requirements for a subdivision. A brief discussion was then held regarding the requirements of the ordinance as it applies to the division of property at hand.\n\n29.

She\nsaid, according to La R.S. 48:391, the department is supposed\nto evaluate the need to close any public railroad crossing. She\ncontinued to say that after they do that, if the evaluation suggests\nclosing, there are certain procedures to follow, such as:\n1. Provide written notice to the local governing\nauthority, which they didn\ufffdt, the railroad company,\nand any affected person owning land within two\nmiles of the railroad crossing, which they didn\ufffdt.\n2. Once they give notice, she would have had a\nchance, within 30 days, to respond. Because they\ndidn\ufffdt give notice, she didn\ufffdt know about it and\ndidn\ufffdt have a chance to respond.\n3. The Department shall attempt to address any\nconcerns. She said they didn\ufffdt follow any of the\nprocedures.\n4. A Notice of Intent to close the crossing should have\nbeen sent, and at that time, a copy of the Intent\nshould have been mailed to the Parish/Council.\nThe local governing authority could submit a\nwritten request to their Chief Engineer of the\nrailroad for a reconsideration of the department\ufffds\ndetermination, which they didn\ufffdt do. Then, the\nrailroad would consider a board, composed of the\nsecretary, the chief engineer of the railroad\ncrossing, and the executive director of the\nLouisiana Highway Safety Commission, shall\nconsider the determination of closing the railroad\ncrossing. And, only then, they would have to\ndetermine, it must be in a manner in which the\nrailroad crossing, they have to prove, unreasonably\nburdens or substantially interferes with the rail\ntransportation.\nPRESENTATION\nTyler Jasmin spoke on the Biddy Basketball Program.
